# Prototyping Smart Textiles

Written By[ Laura Devendorf,](https://github.com/devendork) Sasha De Koninck and Steven Frost with contributions from....

Textiles are so ubiquitous within our built environment that we hardly seem to notice them. Yet, when we look more closely at our clothes, car seats, napkins, couch covers, blankets, rugs, curtains, and on and on, we see the outcome of almost 20,000 years of technological innovation. Look even more closely and you'll see textiles informing the infrastructure of modern computing, from the roped "fiber" that brings us the internet to the programmatic "threads" running processes on our computer. 

The term smart textiles has emerged over the past decade \(or so\) to describe textiles with electronics like sensors and actuators built directly into the textile structure at the level of individuals yarns. The term is misleading because it implies that new technologies have made once "dumb" textiles now intelligent and responsive when in fact, the very structures and fibers of textiles have always been designed to adapt the body to one's environment.  What so-called "smart" materials add to this mix is a set of new design possibilities, of both aesthetic and function, that holds interest and value to multiple fields of practice: from engineers, to craftspeople, to fashion houses, to global telecom networks. 

This book is intended for the smart textiles researcher who is new to the field, and is curious to know more about the processes and levels of textile construction at which they could intervene. For those in textiles or textile engineering, it may provide more information about how metallic and otherwise non-traditional materials can be integrated into these structures in order to provide the capacity for sensing or actuation. 

To honor the many disciplines and ways-of-knowing that come together when experimenting with textiles, we are writing this with an eye towards honoring electronics, materials engineering, and textile crafts/fiber arts as practices of working with and developing deep relationships with materials and the human \(and nonhuman\) ability to "tease form out of those materials." For the experienced weaver or spinner, this text might help provide a new framework and set of experiments to add to your practice, for instance, by considering the specific electrical capacities of different kinds of yarn in addition to their twist and knit quality. We will introduce entry level concepts and applications for experimenting with these materials. 

As an author, I belong to both and neither categories \(as you the reader might identify as well\), so many places will focus on ways of playing around with ideas informally when you simply don't have the skills or access to the equipment you need. While many technical narratives treat craft as mere labor or know-how, we hope to inspire an appreciation of those who have cultivated the skill and technique that many engineering problems so desperately need in order to achieve robust products that use textile materials' inherent structures and functions to perform work otherwise delegated to batteries and computation cycles. 

What we offer here is largely guided through the experiences of those working in the Unstable Design Lab. It is a guidebook for exploring textile structures specifically with the integration of  conductive, biological, or otherwise "experimental" materials in mind. If you want to make some kind of smart, e-textile, soft robotic or flexible electronic project utilizing textile structures and methods, this is for you.
