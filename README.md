# Prototyping Smart Textiles

## What are Smart Textiles?

In any emerging field, it can be hard to find definitive language to describe a set of things. Smart textiles are one of these terms and are often used in relation to other terms such as e-textiles, flexible electronics, functional fabrics, soft computing or computational textiles. In this book, we use smart textiles to mean textile structures that have integrated materials to make them responsive to their environments. This includes:

* the entire history of fabrics \(like wool\) that have been designed with specific functions in mind \(e.g. to keep us warm or cool\) 
* the integration of "smart" or metallic materials for the purposes of making textiles able to communicate with computational systems
* or the introduction of synthetic materials that change state based on their surroundings \(e.g. color changing, stiffness changing, dissolving, etc. materials\).  

These textiles may or may not communicate with a computer, may or may not be "soft", may or may not be worn as clothing \(they apply as much to fashion as they do telecommunications and composites\), and may or may not be new. As such, we use this text to offer a detailed explanation and related resources that focuses on textiles and electronics from the perspective of particular materials, structures,  and processes. This is reflected in the organization of the book: 

* **structures** describe particular arrangements that fiber is brought into to give it particular mechanical characteristics. Structures are adjectives that describe the particular arrangement of fibers \(e.g. a [knit](structure/knit.md), or a [woven](structure/woven.md)\). We start from elemental components such as fibers and grow in complexity to yarns, and then substrates such as fabrics. Within this section, we describe the structures; their general mechanical properties; and the measurements one uses to characterize the structure. 
* **processes** describe actions that a human, machine, animal or whatnot performs upon structures to: transition them into new kinds of structures \(e.g. [knitting](process/knitting.md), [weaving](process/weaving/)\);  change the properties of the structure \(e.g. [dying](process/dying-resists.md)\); or simply add additional functionality on top of an existing set of structures \(e.g. [sewing](process/sewing.md) and [embroidery](process/embroidery.md)\). Within these sections we describe the machines and equipment that facilitate these processes as well as the way in which the processes are documented shared. We also describe the applicability of the process to various kinds of structures.
* **materials** describe the chemical makeup of various materials that make up textile fibers and filaments. Each material brings with it a set of functional characteristics that can be leveraged in design. This section describes the specific properties of each material as well as the different structures within which an everyday person can source the materials. 
* **dynamics** describe particular functionalities that emerge when particular materials are brought into specific structures and relationships, for instance, how a spiral made of a highly conductive material can be used to create a speaker.

### Why Write this Book?

While amazing resources for e-textiles, functional fabrics or computational craft [already exist](resources/collections-of-techniques-and-examples.md), we wanted to write this with a deeper attention to the particular textile craft processes. We did this because we see amazing ways that a designer can intervene at any of these steps to create new kinds of objects, interactions, experiences, and to imbue designs with robust functionality, environmental sustainability, and aesthetic richness. This is informed by my own experience and  journey into the field over the past five years. It is informed as much by the resources listed above as from the practical challenges of figuring out what yarn to buy, or how to measure it, or knowing what it is you might need. 

### Who is this Book For?

We see this as a text as being suited for a **smart textiles researcher** who is new to the field, and is curious to know more about the processes and levels of textile construction at which they could intervene. For **those in textiles or textile engineering**, it may provide more information about how metallic and otherwise non-traditional materials can be integrated into these structures in order to provide the capacity for sensing or actuation. For the experienced **textile craftsperson or fiber artist**, this text might help provide a new framework and set of experiments to add to your practice, for instance, by considering the specific electrical capacities of different kinds of yarn in addition to their twist and knit quality. For **electrical, mechanical and other categories of engineers**, it helps introduce textile processes and structures with specific examples to existing projects. To honor the many disciplines and ways-of-knowing that come together when experimenting with textiles, we are writing this with an eye towards honoring electronics, materials engineering, and textile crafts/fiber arts as practices of working with and developing deep relationships with materials and the human \(and nonhuman\) ability to [tease form out of those materials](http://www.t0.or.at/delanda/matterdl.htm). 

### How Textiles Matter

Textiles are so ubiquitous within our built environment that we hardly seem to notice them. Yet, when we look more closely at our clothes, car seats, napkins, couch covers, blankets, rugs, curtains, and on and on, we see the outcome of almost 20,000 years of technological innovation. Look even more closely and you'll see textiles informing the infrastructure of modern computing, from the roped "fiber" that brings us the internet to the programmatic "threads" running processes on our computer. The term smart textiles has emerged over the past decade \(or so\) to describe textiles with electronics like sensors and actuators built directly into the textile structure at the level of individuals yarns. Yet, we can argue that smart textiles have existed much longer, perhaps even longer than recorded history as the very structures and fibers of textiles have always been designed to adapt the body to one's environment. Furthermore, metallic yarns have long been used to bring ornamental value to garments and the very components upon which our modern technical infrastructures have emerged are directly born from innovations in textiles. So, we want to begin by acknowledging that smart textiles are not new because we believe that histories are useful for inspiring, contextualizing, bringing meaning, and honoring those who have come before. With this in mind, this book aims to serve a resource that holds craft and technology, and history and the future, on equal footing. Craft and engineering are both processes of developing deep connections with materials. And to envision or make the future, so much can be gleaned from looking and adapting from previous examples.

## Learning from the Problematic Histories of Both the Textiles and Electronics Industries

The histories of textiles are the histories of electronics insofar as textiles gave rise to modern computing. Specifically, the jacquard loom became inspiration for IBM's original machines for counting the census, as they operated on a binary logic physicalized in the form of punchcards. These then evolved and adapted into the computers we know today. But beyond computers, the structures of global communications systems, even the present day internet, relay on physical cables spun with materials like copper and fiber-optics in similar fashion to the yarns used in your clothing. The materials may have changed, but the techniques remain those of textiles. 

### Socio-Environmental Legacies of Textiles and Electronics

In this framing, we also see many problems inherent in the textile industry carrying over into modern electronics manufacturing. Specifically, the "invisible labor" of millions of people who make our clothing and electronics, many of which don't offer the basic levels of safety or support for their workers \([source](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/07/business/global/07suicide.html), [source](https://theconversation.com/five-years-after-deadly-factory-fire-bangladeshs-garment-workers-are-still-vulnerable-88027)\). These practices are rooted in histories of slavery, where slaves were brought to the US in order to perform the work of picking cotton for textiles. "Southern cotton, picked and processed by American slaves, helped fuel the nineteenth-century Industrial Revolution in both the United States and Great Britain...By 1850, of the 3.2 million slaves in the \[US's\] fifteen slave states, 1.8 million were producing cotton; by 1860, slave labor was producing over two billion pounds of cotton per year" \([source](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-ushistory1os2xmaster/chapter/the-economics-of-cotton/#:~:text=By%201850%2C%20of%20the%203.2,and%20production%20continued%20to%20soar.)\). Many continue to refer to the textile industry, especially within the Global Souths, as "modern slavery" as the unsafe and force working conditions continue to produce the materials for Western brands \(see "[Tainted Garments](https://www.eco-business.com/opinion/the-invisible-women-and-girls-who-make-your-clothes/)"\). 

Environmentally, textiles \(and now electronics\) are primary sources of the world's waste, water usage and energy usage. A program for the [UN](https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/timber/meetings/2018/20180716/UN_Partnership_on_Sustainable_Fashion_programme_as_of_6-7-2018.pdf) [Partnership on Sustainable Fashion and SDGs](https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/timber/meetings/2018/20180716/UN_Partnership_on_Sustainable_Fashion_programme_as_of_6-7-2018.pdf) \(Sustainable Development Goals\) reports: "fashion is an environmental and social emergency. Nearly 20 percent of global waste water is produced by the fashion industry \(SDG 6\), which also emits about ten percent of global carbon emissions - more than the emissions of all international flights and maritime shipping combined \(SDG 13\). Cotton farming is responsible for 24 percent of insecticides and 11 percent of pesticides despite using only 3 percent of the world’s arable land \(SDG 3\)" These statistics report on fashion only, not considering the additional consumption of textiles for products like carpeting, upholstery, bedding, and so on and so forth. Now let's consider electronic waste, or e-waste. 

The 2020 report from the [Global E-Waste Monitor](https://globalewaste.org/) reports: "In 2019, approximately 53.6 million metric tons \(Mt\) of e-waste \(excluding PV panels\) was generated...the formal documented collection and recycling was 9.3 Mt, thus 17.4% compared to e-waste generated" and that in their predictions recycling activities "are not keeping pace with the global growth of e-waste." \([source](https://publications.globalewaste.org/v1/file/271/The-Global-E-waste-Monitor-2020-Quantities-flows-and-the-circular-economy-potential.pdf)\). 

### Legacies of Cultural Appropriation 

@steven to write this section 

### Socio-Cultural Legacies of Textiles and Electronics Labor

Textiles have long been associated with the of women and indigenous peoples. Anecdotal advice to hacklabs or other groups interested in involving girls and minority populations in computing include activities and sewing machines and textile crafts. This, in itself, is not problematic but sometimes people use these examples to suggest that girls and certain minorities just like or are better at textiles than boys. This wouldn't necessarily be problematic, again, until we see the differing levels of respect that are given to machines like 3D printers and sewing machines and looms \(which are amazing!\).

Historically, we see something more complicated showing how women were often forced into textiles work, even when they may have desired other tasks. This existed even in prestigious institutions like the Bauhaus, as the studios for painting were reserved for men. Craft, or the know-how of making, was relegated to women and "amateurs" and also seen as less valuable than the production of art by geniuses, visionaries, and "experts." We see similar divides taking place in computing, whether in "Letting the Computer Boys take over" where women "computers" were replaced and devalued by male "coders" who scripted the algorithms that were enacted by the women. Other histories, such as Lisa Nakamura's [Indiginous Circuits](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/563663) and Daniela Rosner's [Critical Fabulations](http://criticalfabulations.com/) trace this into contemporary life, demonstrating the way that women were only given options to do certain kind of textile-related work, which was, at once,  devalued _and_ used in commercial materials to appeal to the material's "hand crafted" nature when selling the product. 

Within this frame, it is also important to acknowledge the work of many women \(and some not\) and artists  in forming the foundation upon which modern smart textile products have been built \(and who have personally inspired me\). Folks like Joanna Berzowska, Maggie Orth, Hannah-Perner Wilson, Leah Buechley, Mika Satomi, all those at E-textiles Summer Camp and E-Textiles Spring Break, who have been committed to keeping their work public and open source. And to the many many many others that I am not mentioning by name, thank you. While the media may have us believe that tech giants are inventing the future of smart materials and textiles, the past two decades of work have largely been pioneered outside industry brainstorming sessions and engineering institutions. Textile craft and electronics craft are equally valuable in the formation of innovative and sustainable products,[ we should give practitioners of either or both the same kinds of opportunities and credit](http://unstable.design/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/chi20c-sub9178-cam-i16-2.pdf). 

## Designing With Problematic Histories

Ultimately, this is a book for prototyping smart textiles, which as we have written, has many many problematic histories and presents. Yet, we want to acknowledge that this practice can be valuable and we need people to invent and envision the futures for these kinds of things, while remaining mindful and knowledgable of their histories. We want to be hopeful for better futures \(though this is difficult at times\) and hope you will be to. In that vein, we want to offer some suggestions for prototyping while maintaining a critical focus on the socio-enviromental challenges. Here we want to draw on work of Kavita Philip, Lilly Irani and Paul Dourish to highlight the ways we might push towards a "[postcolonial computing](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0162243910389594)" practice. Their text offers a series of tactics that the authors consider when conducting their field work. Starting from what they built, and reflecting on our own e-textiles/smart textiles practice, we suggest the following: 

_IN PROGRESS FOR NEXT EDITING SESSION_

_Tactic 1: When we consider developing a smart textile prototype, we investigate the many forms of labor and access that allow it to come to be. Who was able to be in the room when the concept was developed, who had the capital to see it through, whose labor was assumed to be available when articulating the concept, who gets to claim authorship of the technique?_

_Tactic 2: When we see the term smart textiles, we ask what it means to be "smart", who has the authority to give it that term. Often times, the description of "new" or "novel" is handed down from those is a position of power while others are considered derivative or "too craft" to be taken seriously._ 

_Tactic 3: When we see claims of inherent technological and cultural difference, we apply STS methods symmetrically to both the technology and the culture at hand. But we do not stop there; we proceed to deconstruct the binary between technology and culture and study the impure crossings between them. When we see an instance of indigenous science or ‘‘native’’ technology, we investigate it not as an instance of inherent difference or autochthonous authenticity but as a practice with the same epistemological status as putatively Western sciences. In other words, our categories, while always subject to grounded interrogation and theoretical critique, emerge from assumptions of diachronic imbrication rather than synchronic incommensurability."_
