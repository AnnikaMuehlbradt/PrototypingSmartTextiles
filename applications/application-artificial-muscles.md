# Artificial Muscles

Lets start with a [McKibben artificial muscle](https://softroboticstoolkit.com/book/pneumatic-artificial-muscles#:~:text=The%20muscles%20consist%20of%20an,radial%20expansion%20into%20linear%20contraction.) which consists of a rope that is braided around a ****hollow tube. When you pressurize the fluid \(air or water\) in the tube, the braided structure amplifies the movement. In most DIY examples, we see these made by simply buying a pre-made braided hollow cord and shoving a hollow tube down the center of it.

Which is actually a really great adaptation to making your own braided structures that folks like Irene Posch have used to make other things, [like custom e-textile "alligator clips"](http://www.ireneposch.net/tooling/). Some other folks have taken this idea, made longer muscles and woven them through other fabrics to see what shapes they make:

Okay so lets now combine that with another fun discovery: the fact that when you coil and heat monofilament, nylon fishing line, you can make a single filament that is quite strong:

If I'm understanding this video correctly, they have essentially mimicked the braided structure of McKibben muscles using these nylon muscles to provide even more lifting power to the structure So now you can consider that the tube and pneumatic pump need not even exist, the braid can do its own expanding and contracting. Better yet, these monofilament muscles are heat/voltage activated, so you can braid them with conductive or resistive heating wires to integrate the actuating elements uniformly along the length \(or non-uniformly if you're into that kind of thing\). Maybe you want to have some feedback mechanism, like having a reading that tells you how much the muscle is expanding. Well then, just integrate another yarn that [change is properties when stretched](https://softroboticstoolkit.com/smart-braids), perhaps with a change in resistance or inductance. Maybe you want to have the system activate on touch. Okay then, just add another yarn that offer capacitive sensing \(or make your hands really hot to by-pass the conductive just get right to the point. How do you make these kinds of things? Answer: braiding or plying \(we'll get to that later on this page\). 

And if you're head isn't already spinning with ideas for tubing and braiding, I'll leave you with this:
