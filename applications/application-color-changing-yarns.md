# Color-Changing Yarns

I was able to collaborate with the Project Jacquard team during the early stages of this project \(and this experience largely inspired a much deeper dive into textiles after the collaboration\). It took a while before we were able to get this very special yarn, so in the meantime, we used a simpler version that consisted on a single magnet wire plied with silk. This structure is much easier to mimc by hand. What [Joanne Lo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joanneclo), another collaborator on the project, noticed about the very few and very tiny yarn samples we did have was that they were really good resistive heaters. Basically, if you pump voltage into a very thin wire, it causes it to heat up. Furthermore, those heating wires were directly in contact with the fabric shell or sheath, meaning that very little heat would be lost. While on one hand, you can imagine a warming jacket or socks, we decided to coat the yarns with [thermochromic pigments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermochromism) that change color at different ranges of temperature. This concept had been really beautifully illustrated by [Maggie Orth](http://www.maggieorth.com/art_100EAYears.html) and others beginning in 2009 and we played around with integrating the yarns in various stitches to see what kinds of effects we could come up with.
