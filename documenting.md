## Describing Staple **Fiber**

## **Measuring Filament**

## **Roving**

The most primary fiber structure is roving or top, produced by combing or carding individual fibers into into a common direction prior to spinning. Typically, this structure is produced prior to [spinning](structures/string-and-filament.md#spinning) it into a "single" strand of yarn. Woolen yarns are typically spun from worsted fibers into more airy warns. Worsted yarns are made from longer fiber lengths that are combed into roving, creating stronger yarns.
