# Dynamics

## **Circuit Basics**

The most critical points to understand for our introduction, or when beginning, is a deep understanding of resistance and how it varies \(by shape, temperature, material and cross-sectional area\). This helps us understand how we can use resistance as a way to measure changes to our soft structures and whether or not those changes mean what we think they mean. It will also help in determining your material choice of any conductive materials. I found Khan Academy to be an excellent resource for me to brush up on my understanding. Its also worth noting that most circuits we will be describing operate on direct current \(or DC\).

## **Traces** 

woven ribbon cables  
sewn traces

## **Connections**

What is the smart textile equivalent of a wire or bus. The answer is thread and typically a low resistance thread such as copper. 

sewn connections  
snap connections  
bonded connections    
minigrabbers and clips  
Irene's connections 

## **Insulating**

Methods for isolating your traces so they do not short or cross where you don't want them.   

Common Coatings \(poly, silicone\)  
Core Spun Materials  
****isolating ****layers ****

## **Resistors**

basic structure // resistors are just pieces of material  
techniques for sewing resistors  
weaving resistors  
knitting resistors \(knitted radio examples\)

## **Capacitors** 

knitted capacitors \(knitted radio\)  
woven capacitors

## **Transistor**

I've seen some research published on this, keep looking

**Custom Capacitive Sensing Yarn:** 

According to the original announcement, there were three main challenges in this. First, you needed a yarn that could withstand industrial manufacturing machines. Second, they wanted it to not be grey, and Third, they wanted it to be responsive to capacitive touch. Because they are Google, they were able to work with industrial suppliers to engineer their own yarn which consists of three magnet wires or filaments in the core \(middle\) which were then braided \(on a very fun to watch maypole machine!\) with a dyeable and durable fiber: silk. They used copper because its very conductive; silk because its really strong and dyes into really brilliant colors; and a braided structure because it could withstand large amounts of force. While we can note that this was certainly not the first conductive yarn to be core spun or to allow for capacitive touch sensing, what is interesting is what is possible with you have access to equipment that is otherwise unaccessible. They could really precisely tune the material to the function they hand in mind and the infrastructure that they would need it to work within.

## Shape Change

artificial muscles

Lets start with a [McKibben artificial muscle](https://softroboticstoolkit.com/book/pneumatic-artificial-muscles#:~:text=The%20muscles%20consist%20of%20an,radial%20expansion%20into%20linear%20contraction.) which consists of a rope that is braided around a ****hollow tube. When you pressurize the fluid \(air or water\) in the tube, the braided structure amplifies the movement. In most DIY examples, we see these made by simply buying a pre-made braided hollow cord and shoving a hollow tube down the center of it.

## Color Change 

Thermochromic  
 [Maggie Orth](http://www.maggieorth.com/art_100EAYears.html) and others beginning in 2009 and we played around with integrating the yarns in various stitches to see what kinds of effects we could come up with.
