# Circuit Basics

The most critical points to understand for our introduction, or when beginning, is a deep understanding of resistance and how it varies \(by shape, temperature, material and cross-sectional area\). This helps us understand how we can use resistance as a way to measure changes to our soft structures and whether or not those changes mean what we think they mean. It will also help in determining your material choice of any conductive materials. I found Khan Academy to be an excellent resource for me to brush up on my understanding of circuitry and resistance in general. Its also worth noting that most circuits we will be describing operate on direct current \(or DC\).
