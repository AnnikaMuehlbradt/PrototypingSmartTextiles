# Staple Fibers

## Why learn about staple fibers?

It is our opinion that all textiles are smart because fibers, the building blocks of textiles, have adapted or been engineered smart and responsive. Technically, a fiber is a material with "high length to width ratio" and they form the basic building blocks of yarn, which is a basic building block of fabric, which is a basic building block of pre-historic and contemporary culture. Filaments are another class of textile material that are basically very long and continuous fibers. They are most often produced through extrusion, where a bulk of pliable material is pushed through little holes to make long stringy things. These are often commonly used in textiles, especially in the production of synthetics or metallic/conductive textile materials.  

## Processing Stable Fibers 

Where do staple fibers come from and how are they processed \(generally\)?

### Obtaining/Synthesizing Raw Fibers 

### Carding and Combing

### Roving and Top



## Describing Staple Fibers

* **staple length** - this is a discrete measure of the average length of each fiber, typically measured in mm. The length of the fiber determines how thin/thick the resulting yarn needs to be and how it may feel against the skin \(in combination with many other factors\). Typically, very soft garments, come from short "downy" staple fibers collected from sheep or goats. Longer fibers tend to be stronger and used in more utilitarian applications like upholstery or rope making.
* **fiber diameter** - cross section measured in nm. 
* **crimp** - 
* **fiber type** 

### **Using Burn Tests to Determine Fiber Type**

## Common Fiber Types and Their Properties

### Wool \(Sheep's\)

Wool fiber is harvested from sheep and can be obtained in many different grades that make it softer, more brash, etc. for different purposes. Wool is often noted for its unique "crimped" structure and elasticity. These little crimps or barbs, make it hold really nicely to other fibers when it is spun into yarn, also making it a bit more durable \(as long as it isn't wet\). This means that when it is spun into yarn, it contains a lot of air inside of its structure. Additionally, the cellular makeup of wool makes it particularly good at "wicking" moisture and absorbing it. I have heard that wool can absorb 30% of its weight in water and still remain dry to the touch. This keeps the body cool and dry, and also allows wool to have natural anti-static properties, meaning it won't cling to your skin and, in terms of electronics, won't build up charge. Wool has a really high specific thermal resistance, which means that it can keep heat from spreading \(and is naturally fire resistant\), which is why people living in the hot climates wore cloaks made of wool. In my own experiences with thermochromics on fabrics, its thermal properties mean the heat created from my heating wire do not spread far, isolating color change to very specific regions. In some cases, this allows color change to appear on one side of the fabric, and not the other \(for instance\). The elasticity of wool means that it can hold its shape \(or have "memory"\) better than other fibers, as long as it isn't wet.

### Fibers

Fibers are spun together to make string, which is plied or braided to make yarn, ropes and cables of different types. The different choices of fiber offer specific functional properties to your project that relate to everything from how soft and warm it is to how well it serves as an insulator within electronic textiles. The core features describing fibers are: 

* **staple length** - this is a discrete measure of the average length of each fiber, typically measured in mm. The length of the fiber determines how thin/thick the resulting yarn needs to be and how it may feel against the skin \(in combination with many other factors\). Typically, very soft garments, come from short "downy" staple fibers collected from sheep or goats. Longer fibers tend to be stronger and used in more utilitarian applications like upholstery or rope making.
* **fiber diameter** - cross section measured in nm. 
* **crimp** - 
* **fiber type** 

**Fiber Types**

Fibers for textiles are broken down into two broad classes: natural \(originating from natural systems or animals\)  synthetic \(engineered and produced in factories\). Natural fibers are further broken down into protein and cellulose fibers. Synthetically produced protein and cellulose fibers also exist. The table below shows some examples. 

|  | Synthetic | Natural |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Cellulose | Rayon | Cotton, Linen |
| Protein | [MicrosilkTM](https://boltthreads.com/technology/microsilk/) | Wool, Silk |
| Synthetic | Polyester, Nylon |  |

**Natural Protein Fibers**   
Natural protein fibers are either grown or secreted from insects, like spiders. The name "protein" is chosen because they are composed largely of amino acid polypeptide chains. The most popular cases are wool \(e.g. sheep fur\), and silk \(e.g. silk worm cocoons\), yet other protein fibers are harvested from animals such as sheep, goat, alpaca, musk ox, yak, spiders, etc. etc. 

Protein fibers share properties in common. They are particularly unique in their ability to maintain elasticity and their ability to absorb moisture. Yet, variations exist between the various sources of protein fibers.

Wool is often noted for its unique "crimped" structure and elasticity.

**Natural Cellulose Fibers** 

en bonding between OH groups on adjacent chains, causing them to pack closely into cellulose fibers. As a result, cellulose exhibits little interaction with water or any other solvent. Cotton and wood, for example, are completely insoluble in water and have considerable mechanical strength

The basis of all textiles if fiber, specifically described as "a thread or filament from which a vegetable tissue, mineral substance, or textile is formed." These are the individual little pieces of fur, bark, bamboo, or stringy plant stuff that from which string and yarn are made. Each of these fibers.





ADD THIS SOMEWHERE HERE: 

The hand-spinning process starts by obtaining fibers which are sold in **worsted** or **woolen** form. Worsted means that the fibers are combed so that they all align in the same direction and are of uniform length. This is often used for making yarns that are more  uniform, lustrous in color, durable, and a little wirey. Packages of worsted fiber are called "top" and you can buy them for your own hand-spinning projects.

Woolen means that the fibers are "carded" which "encourages the fibers to lie in multiple directions" \[yarn-i-tec-ture\]. Fibers of all different lengths are kept in this process. The goal of carding is to build up enough of a "mesh" of fibers that they hold together. These meshes, and the process, yields more airy, fluffy and soft yarns. Bundles of worsted fibers are most often called "roving" but you different preparations go by names batts, rolags, fauxlags, puin, cloud, and wool locks, each of which offers, as you expect, its own set of unique qualities to the fibers.

To make matters more confusing, the terms worsted and woolen also describe techniques you can use to feed or "draft" the fibers from your top or roving into the wheel.  These, again, allow for more or less air to become trapped into the yarn, changing its thickness, durability, and likely its capacity for insulation \(I'm guessing, since air is a good insulator\). I won't get into the specifics of how to draft with each of these techniques, but I'm finding the book "Yarn-i-tec-ture" to be a great resource for those interested in going farther. The main point here is to say that the process of spinning is far from uniform. Even if you are spinning with the exact same fiber, the preparation and spin will result in very different properties.

The final step in yarn production is finishing, by which the yarn can be washed, steamed, lassoed, whacked, menaced, and a whole host of other hilarious words, to help the yarn achieve is final state. This is essentially a process of making the yarn resemble the state you want it to stay in and you really don't know much until you've washed and laundered a textile project \(which is always frightening to me\).
