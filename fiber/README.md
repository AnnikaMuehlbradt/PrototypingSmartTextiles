# Selecting Fiber Types

Technically, a fiber is a material with "high length to width ratio" and they form the basic building blocks of yarn, which is a basic building block of fabric, which is a basic building block of pre-historic and contemporary culture. 

## Why Learn About Fiber Types?

So often in smart textiles development, we delegate "smartness" to the sensing or conductive wires/threads we integrate into our textiles. However, the traditional fibers of textiles, like wool or cotton, are also adaptive and responsive in many ways. They can be creatively combined and used with other materials to amplify or bring out specific qualities.  If we understand the properties and attributes that each fiber brings to the table, we might be able to make a wise decision about whether to use copper or silver wire in conjunction with wool or cotton base yarns depending on our application. For instance, if we want the use the wire to generate heat and want the body of the fabric to act as insulation, we would use wool. If we want the wire to simply transmit energy from here to there, and we are most concerned with the washability of our project, then we might choose silver and cotton. This chapter might be best used as a kind of reference material, but it offers an explanation of different fiber types to aid you in picking one for your project. 

## **Fiber Sources**

Fibers can be harvested from natural sources or synthesized within labs.  

### Harvesting

Harvested fibers come from materials such as plant matter, the fur of animals, or the cocoons of insects like worms. These resources are renewable, in a sense, if they are managed carefully. After being harvested, they are cleaned for processing into yarn. This often produces by-products in addition to the fiber itself. For instance, sheep are very very oily. When sheep's wool is collected, the oils that come off the wool are used to create "lanolin" a common ingredient in lotions. The cleaned fibers can then be used to create yarns. The silk harvested from cocoons is often the longest form of natural fiber, as each individual strand can be as long as 1000-3000 feet.  

### **Extruding**

A second common process uses processes of extrusion. In these cases, materials are processed into a liquid like goo \(think play-doh\) and pressed through narrow openings named after a spider's "spinneret." The single streams of material emerging from the spinneret are either  spun directly into fiber or deposited into liquid chemical baths as part of their structural formation. Often, extruding gives rise to filaments, where long continuous fibers are created. In other cases, the streams can be kept at deliberately short lengths to simulate more staple fiber like qualities \(think steel wool\).  

If you have an afternoon handy, there are many many youtube videos that describe how 

## Describing Fibers

There are many many features of fibers to describe, but what we'll focus on but two of the most common are:  **staple length** - this is a discrete measure of the average length of each fiber, typically measured in mm. The length of the fiber determines how thin/thick the resulting yarn needs to be and how it may feel against the skin \(in combination with many other factors\). Typically, very soft garments, come from short "downy" staple fibers collected from sheep or goats. Longer fibers tend to be stronger and used in more utilitarian applications like upholstery or rope making. **fiber diameter** - cross section of a fiber measured in nanometers. Another quality of interest is the **moisture regain** of the fiber, which is the amount of the fiber's weight which can be made up of water. This corresponds roughly to the absorbency of the fiber, and takes into account that many fibers can retain water without feeling wet. 

Fibers come from many kinds of substances but  generally broken down into two classes based on their _staple length_: **Staple fibers** are fibers of fixed length, often emerging from natural materials like fur and plants. **Filaments** are fibers of continuous quality and of very long, if not \(theoretically\) infinite, length. These are often made of synthetic materials and produced through processes of extrusion. But more on this later.

For the sake of our explanation of fibers and their properties, we will also describe particular qualities that contribute to a materials conductivity, resistance, and thermal conductance. **Conductivity** refers to how easily electricity can move through the fiber. If it conducts electricity relatively easily, it is colloquially called a conductive fiber. If electricity has a difficult time moving through the fiber, it is colloquially called an **insulator**. Similarly, at times you will hear the terms conductive or resistive used to describe conductive fibers. This generally applies only the the fibers that are easily conductive and basically differentiates how conductive they are. A conductive yarn means it is very conductive \(meaning it has low resistance\), or less conductive \(meaning it has more resistance\). 

Keep in mind, that these measures will change based on how tightly the fibers are wound \(which we can leverage for sensing\), the kinds of structures they are integrated into and external factors like how wet the fiber is and how much voltage is being applied to them.

### Wool \(Sheep's\)

![Source: https://archive.org/details/cu31924031496833](../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-07-16-at-1.07.21-pm.png)

Wool fiber is harvested from sheep and can be obtained in many different grades that make it softer, more brash, etc. for different purposes. Typically, wools with shorter and final staple lengths \(like cashmere or merino\) are carded into woolen yarns for exceptional softness. Longer staple fibers are used for more durable applications. Wool is often noted for its unique "crimped" structure, elasticity, and durability \(in the sense that you can bend the fibers lots and they don't break\). The little crimps or barbs of the wool fiber, make it hold really nicely to other fibers when it is spun into yarn, also making it a bit more durable \(as long as it isn't wet\). Because of these crimps, wool fibers line up in yarn with little pockets of air between them. These little air pockets give it is insulating qualities and heat and cold can't easily move through the contained little air pockets. It is naturally fire resistant \(to some degree\).  Additionally, the cellular makeup of wool makes it particularly good at "wicking" moisture and absorbing it. 

"Wool fibers are made up of cortical cells, and these cells are wrapped in cuticle. This scaly outer layer is then covered by yet another layer, the epicuticle -- a filmy skin that helps to repel moisture. What's more, the epicuticle also helps out in high humidity because it has tiny pores that draw in the moisture vapor to the center of the fiber where it's absorbed by a chemical process. The hydrogen bond of [water](https://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/earth/geophysics/h2o.htm#pt0), H2O, is actually broken, creating a chemical reaction with the wool fiber molecules to generate heat when it has taken on a lot of moisture. But because the air pockets allow moisture to evaporate from your skin, you won't overheat when you sweat." \[[Source](https://adventure.howstuffworks.com/outdoor-activities/hiking/wool-when-wet2.htm)\]

I have heard that wool can absorb 30% of its weight in water and still remain dry to the touch. This keeps the body cool and dry, and also allows wool to have natural anti-static properties, meaning it won't cling to your skin and, in terms of electronics, won't build up charge.  In my own experiences with thermochromics on fabrics, its thermal properties mean the heat created from my heating wire do not spread far, isolating color change to very specific regions. In some cases, this allows color change to appear on one side of the fabric, and not the other \(for instance\). The elasticity of wool means that it can hold its shape \(or have "memory"\) better than other fibers, as long as it isn't wet.

Silk is a protein fiber that is harvested from the cocoons of silk worms. There are many varieties of silk depending on the species, diet, etc. of the worm that spun the cocoon. The two main kinds of silk are "mulberry" and "tussah" silk. Mulberry silk comes from the domesticated species "bombyx mori” and is a bit finer and of higher quality as it comes from a very specific breed of worm whose diet consists only of mulberry leaves. Tussah silk comes from a variety of species who live wild largely in South Asia. The general structure of wool \(the cross-section\) is roughly triangular will curved corners. This allows it to reflect light well and gives it a really nice sheen.

It is our opinion that all textiles are smart because fibers, the building blocks of textiles, have adapted or been engineered smart and responsive. Technically, a fiber is a material with "high length to width ratio" and they form the basic building blocks of yarn, which is a basic building block of fabric, which is a basic building block of pre-historic and contemporary culture. Filaments are another class of textile material that are basically very long and continuous fibers. They are most often produced through extrusion, where a bulk of pliable material is pushed through little holes to make long stringy things. These are often commonly used in textiles, especially in the production of synthetics or metallic/conductive textile materials.  

### Fibers

Fibers are spun together to make string, which is plied or braided to make yarn, ropes and cables of different types. The different choices of fiber offer specific functional properties to your project that relate to everything from how soft and warm it is to how well it serves as an insulator within electronic textiles. There are many many features of fibers to describe, but what we'll focus on but two of the most common are:  

* **staple length** - this is a discrete measure of the average length of each fiber, typically measured in mm. The length of the fiber determines how thin/thick the resulting yarn needs to be and how it may feel against the skin \(in combination with many other factors\). Typically, very soft garments, come from short "downy" staple fibers collected from sheep or goats. Longer fibers tend to be stronger and used in more utilitarian applications like upholstery or rope making.
* **fiber diameter** - cross section of a fiber measured in nanometers.

**Fiber Types**

Fibers for textiles are broken down into two broad classes: natural \(originating from natural systems or animals\)  synthetic \(engineered and produced in factories\). Natural fibers are further broken down into protein and cellulose fibers. Synthetically produced protein and cellulose fibers also exist. The table below shows some examples. 

|  | Synthetic | Natural |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Cellulose | Rayon | Cotton, Linen |
| Protein | [MicrosilkTM](https://boltthreads.com/technology/microsilk/) | Wool, Silk |
| Synthetic | Polyester, Nylon |  |

**Natural Protein Fibers**   
Natural protein fibers are either grown or secreted from insects, like spiders. The name "protein" is chosen because they are composed largely of amino acid polypeptide chains. The most popular cases are wool \(e.g. sheep fur\), and silk \(e.g. silk worm cocoons\), yet other protein fibers are harvested from animals such as sheep, goat, alpaca, musk ox, yak, spiders, etc. etc. 

Protein fibers share properties in common. They are particularly unique in their ability to maintain elasticity and their ability to absorb moisture. Yet, variations exist between the various sources of protein fibers.

**Sheep's Wool**   
Wool fiber is harvested from sheep and can be obtained in many different grades that make it softer, more brash, etc. for different purposes. Wool is often noted for its unique "crimped" structure and elasticity. These little crimps or barbs, make it hold really nicely to other fibers when it is spun into yarn, also making it a bit more durable \(as long as it isn't wet\). This means that when it is spun into yarn, it contains a lot of air inside of its structure. Additionally, the cellular makeup of wool makes it particularly good at "wicking" moisture and absorbing it. I have heard that wool can absorb 30% of its weight in water and still remain dry to the touch. This keeps the body cool and dry, and also allows wool to have natural anti-static properties, meaning it won't cling to your skin and, in terms of electronics, won't build up charge. Wool has a really high specific thermal resistance, which means that it can keep heat from spreading \(and is naturally fire resistant\), which is why people living in the hot climates wore cloaks made of wool. In my own experiences with thermochromics on fabrics, its thermal properties mean the heat created from my heating wire do not spread far, isolating color change to very specific regions. In some cases, this allows color change to appear on one side of the fabric, and not the other \(for instance\). The elasticity of wool means that it can hold its shape \(or have "memory"\) better than other fibers, as long as it isn't wet.

The basis of all textiles if fiber, specifically described as "a thread or filament from which a vegetable tissue, mineral substance, or textile is formed." These are the individual little pieces of fur, bark, bamboo, or stringy plant stuff that from which string and yarn are made. Each of these fibers.





ADD THIS SOMEWHERE HERE: 

The hand-spinning process starts by obtaining fibers which are sold in **worsted** or **woolen** form. Worsted means that the fibers are combed so that they all align in the same direction and are of uniform length. This is often used for making yarns that are more  uniform, lustrous in color, durable, and a little wirey. Packages of worsted fiber are called "top" and you can buy them for your own hand-spinning projects.

Woolen means that the fibers are "carded" which "encourages the fibers to lie in multiple directions" \[yarn-i-tec-ture\]. Fibers of all different lengths are kept in this process. The goal of carding is to build up enough of a "mesh" of fibers that they hold together. These meshes, and the process, yields more airy, fluffy and soft yarns. Bundles of worsted fibers are most often called "roving" but you different preparations go by names batts, rolags, fauxlags, puin, cloud, and wool locks, each of which offers, as you expect, its own set of unique qualities to the fibers.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U3fWNJLVyw

To make matters more confusing, the terms worsted and woolen also describe techniques you can use to feed or "draft" the fibers from your top or roving into the wheel.  These, again, allow for more or less air to become trapped into the yarn, changing its thickness, durability, and likely its capacity for insulation \(I'm guessing, since air is a good insulator\). I won't get into the specifics of how to draft with each of these techniques, but I'm finding the book "Yarn-i-tec-ture" to be a great resource for those interested in going farther. The main point here is to say that the process of spinning is far from uniform. Even if you are spinning with the exact same fiber, the preparation and spin will result in very different properties.

The final step in yarn production is finishing, by which the yarn can be washed, steamed, lassoed, whacked, menaced, and a whole host of other hilarious words, to help the yarn achieve is final state. This is essentially a process of making the yarn resemble the state you want it to stay in and you really don't know much until you've washed and laundered a textile project \(which is always frightening to me\).
