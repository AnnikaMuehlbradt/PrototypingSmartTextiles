Silk is a protein fiber that is harvested from the cocoons of silk worms. There are many varieties of silk depending on the species, diet, etc. of the worm that spun the cocoon. The two main kinds of silk are "mulberry" and "tussah" silk. Mulberry silk comes from the domesticated species "bombyx mori‚Äù and is a bit finer and of higher quality as it comes from a very specific breed of worm whose diet consists only of mulberry leaves. Tussah silk comes from a variety of species who live wild largely in South Asia. The general structure of wool \(the cross-section\) is roughly triangular will curved corners. This allows it to reflect light well and gives it a really nice sheen.
