# Metallic Fibers

Metallic fibers are those that conduct electricity and are often blended, as fibers or filaments with non-conductive fibers to make workable yarn. 

The table below represents the resistivity of metallic yarns in comparison to other natural and synthetic fibers. The metallic fibers numbers are consistently measured where the other numbers should be taken with a VERY BIG grain of salt as I wasn't able to find consistent measurements across fibers so they represent whatever I could find anywhere. 

The table below shows that silver is the least resistive \(most conductive\), copper than stainless \(with some in between, but I just included these fibers since they are the most commonly sourced.

## **Copper**

....

## **Silver**

Silver is said to have anti-odor and anti-bacterial properties that make it popular in athletic wear and other applications. Because its highly conductive, it will feel cool to the touch. Much of the silver conductive yarns sold are other materials like polymers that have been silver plated, instead of solid silver. This method will determine exactly how conductive your silver yarn will be. 

## Stainless Steel

Stainless is not quite as conductive as copper and silver. It is more often made from stainless roving or fibers, making them a bit coarse and grabby \(making them harder to handsew or more rough to the touch.
