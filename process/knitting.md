# Knitting

Knitted structures are produced through combinations of two primary stitches. Those stitches, used in particular combinations and will particular equipment, give rise to all knitted fabrics and can be used to make flat surfaces or shapes of an arbitrary volume.  These structured are most often achieved through the use of needles or hooks manipulated by hand or machine, as each stitch is essentially a method of pulling one loop through another loop. Knits and an inherently stretchy structure that can easily unravel.

### **Selecting Yarn and Needle Size**

The relationship between the gauge of your yarn \(e.g. how thick it is\) and the size of your knitting needle determines the drape or hand of your knitted textile. Most skeins of yarn will recommend a knitting needle size, but there are ways to play around with knits to create textiles that have multiple properties. For instance, you can use multiple needles when knitting, and change the tension of the knit as you are working. One could use a chunky yarn with a small needle to create a dense knitted textile. Or a lace weight yarn with large needles to create a very loose, soft textile. One fabric can change from densely knitted to and large open knit just by changing needle size.

For instance, I knitting a small 10 stitch x 10 stitch stockinette swatch using three different US needle sizes, 19, 8 and 4 and the image below shows the results. The \(poorly knit\) swatch on the left had the largest needles \(at 19\) and resulted in the loosest structure. The center swatch was knit with the recommended needle size \(8\) and the swatch on the right was size 4. All swatches were stretchy with the most open structure stretching the most radically.

### Casting On

The first step in knitting casting on, which means creating the first row structure that you will build your stitches upon. We will show these techniques as they are associated with each link below. 

### Knitting: Primary Stitches & Patterns

Knitted structures are created through combinations and patterning of two knitted stitches: **knit** and **purl**. A stitch that appears on one side of the fabric as a "knit" will be read as a "purl" from the back of the fabric. When looking at the front face of a fabric, the knit stitches are those that have their "arms" or sides of the loop on the surface \(and their "necks" on the backside\). Purls are those with their arms on the back side of the fabric and their necks on the front \(as shown in b\). 

**Rib Stitch**: If we are to read \(c\) from the bottom row, left you right, we would read "knit, purl, knit, purl" and the same for the subsequent rows. This combination is a ****"rib" stitch and its commonly found at the end of your sleeves on sweaters or collars. Rib stitches are good for stretching and compressing along its width.

**Garter Stitch**: In \(d\) we would read the bottom row as all knits, the next row as all knits, and on and on. This is called a **garter stitch** and its created by stitching all knit or all purl. 

**Stockinette Stitch**: Another common structure is a **stockinette**, which is creating by alternating knit and purl along each row.  So, one entire row is knit purl across its length, the next knit, the next purl etc.

### Bind Off

The last step in knitting is the bind off, which secures the structure from unraveling. 



| Structure | Ability to be Knitted |
| :--- | :--- |
| Raw Fiber | no, needs to be in the form of singles first |
| Filament | yes |
| Roving & Top | yes, for a more open and loose structure  |
| Singles | yes |
| Plied Yarn | yes |
| Braided Rope | yes |
| Knits | yes for tubular knits or narrow flat knits |
| Woven | yes for narrow, flat, or tubular weaves |
| Non-Wovens | yes, if sliced or rolled into thin long pieces |
| Solid Objects | yes, if its something you can thread through  |

### Hand Knitting

Hand knitting takes place with knitting needles, manipulated by the hands. This technique allows for playful discovery of stitches and structures and, depending on the kind of needle, can be used to knit surfaces, tubes, or volumes.  The material, gauge, stitch, and needle size all shift the texture of the knit itself, giving way to more stretchy, bully, light, or rigid textures. Textures in handknitting can change at any point in the process across the surface by changing the stitch. This is how you can create one garment with different properties in different regions.

### **Machine Knitting**

There are two main types of knitting machines that can used for tabletop knitting. These machines are made possible through "[latchhook needles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccepDc_4gV4)."  A [flat bed machine](https://www.xdknitmachinery.com/knitting-machine-for-beginners/),  comes in two 'gauges', standard and chunky. The gauge of the machine refers to the spacing between the needles in the bed of the machine, which allows for different size yarns to run through the machine. These machines can be programmed electronically, or via punchcard. Punchcard machines are possible to find at second hand shops or in giveaway piles but need tender love and care to work properly. The second type of knitting machine is a '[V-bed](https://textiles.ncsu.edu/tatm/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2017/11/Choi_full_145_05.pdf)' machine. V-bed knitting machines allow for more complex stitch structures and for double knits, and seamless knitting. These are more difficult to happen upon but are most common in industrial knitting. The two beds, arranged in a V, are able to pass yarns back and forth across the layers. Another common kind of machine for knitting is a [circular knitting machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccepDc_4gV4), where needles are arranged along the edge of a circle to create a continuous tubular knit for objects like hats and socks. Circular knitting machines are readily available in varying levels of quality.

**Industrial Knitting:**   
Industrial knitting machines produce the garments that we purchase in stores today. They are programmed via computer and can knit incredibly complex structures, and seamless garments. One machine can do many things and accommodate different yarns, rather than having different machines for different structures and yarns. There are also industrial circular knitting machines that can knit tubes of fabric, spacer textiles, and multilayer knit fabrics. Most industrial knitting machines are produced two one of two brands: [Shima Seiki](https://www.shimaseiki.com/) or [Stoll](https://www.stoll.com/en/). These machines are becoming more popular within university research labs and maker spaces.
