# Spinning

Spinning is a process of adding twist to fibers \(in the form of top or roving\) such that they form into a more structured and "balanced" yarn, which means that it won't un-spin easily. Spinning top or roving  produces [singles](../structure/singles.md), a single strand of twisted yarn. Singles are unbalanced \(their twist is only in one direction\) and their are not very durable. It is also possible to spin raw fibers around other structures, such as wires or filaments in a process of [core spinning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nAfv3O_Qrk). 

To spin, a spinner drafts, or feeds, a collection of fibers into their spinning devices \(wheel or spindle\). The spinner users their hands \(or otherwise\) to control the propagation of the spin up the length of the unspun fiber. As the spin propagates along the length of the fiber, it is wound onto a spool. The final step in spinning is called finishing, by which the yarn can be washed, steamed, lassoed, whacked, menaced, and a whole host of other hilarious words, to help the yarn achieve is final state. This is essentially a process of making the yarn resemble the state you want it to stay in and you really don't know much until you've washed and laundered a textile project \(which is always frightening to me\).

| Structure | Ability to be Spun |
| :--- | :--- |
| Raw Fiber | yes, but not in a meaningful length |
| Filament | yes, if integrated as a core |
| Roving & Top | yes |
| Singles | yes, perhaps to add extra spin or customization |
| Plied Yarn | not sure \(add extra twist?\) |
| Braided Rope | not sure \(add extra twist?\) |
| Knits | no |
| Woven | no |
| Non-Wovens | no |
| Solid Objects | no |

### Spinning with a Spinning Wheel

The most common method of spinning requires a spinning wheel \(yes, the machine of fairy tale lore\), which requires a substantial amount of technique and know how to use it effectively. A spinning wheel requires the spinner to use their feet to spin the wheel at an even pace and both their hands to draw the fibers into the wheel. It is faster and produces higher quality yarn than the other techniques.

### Spinning with a Drop Spindle

A more accessible method of spinning can be accomplished using a drop spindle. A drop spindle is a modified top that one manually spins in order to add twist to the fiber.  This is an ancient practice that still largely resembles its process from 20,000 years ago. For those interested in how these techniques varied in medieval times by region, you may [enjoy this demonstration of technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&v=RERnzaTREyM&feature=emb_title).
