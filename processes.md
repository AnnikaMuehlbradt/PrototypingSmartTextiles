# Processes

## Combing & Carding

Carding yarns  "encourages the fibers to lie in multiple directions" \[yarn-i-tec-ture\] and is referred to as a "woolen" preparation of fibers. Carding fibers produces roving. Fibers of all different lengths are kept in this process. The goal of carding is to build up enough of a "mesh" of fibers that they hold together. These meshes, and the process, yields more airy, fluffy and soft yarns. Bundles of woolen fibers are most often called "roving" but you different preparations go by names batts, rolags, fauxlags, puin, cloud, and wool locks, each of which offers, as you expect, its own set of unique qualities to the fibers.

Combing fibers allows them to all align in the same direction.  This is used on fibers that then to be a uniform length. This preparation of fiber is called "worsted".  It is often used for making yarns that are more uniform, lustrous in color, durable, and a little wirey. Packages of worsted fiber are called "top"

## Spinning 

Spinning is a process of adding twist to fibers such that they form into a more structured and durable yarn. Spinning raw fibers produces singles while it is also possible to spin raw fibers around other structures, such as wires or filaments. 

To spin, a spinner drafts, or feeds, a collection of fibers into their spinning devices \(wheel or spindle\). As the spin propagates along the length of the fiber, it is wound onto a spool. The final step in spinning is called  finishing, by which the yarn can be washed, steamed, lassoed, whacked, menaced, and a whole host of other hilarious words, to help the yarn achieve is final state. This is essentially a process of making the yarn resemble the state you want it to stay in and you really don't know much until you've washed and laundered a textile project \(which is always frightening to me\).

## Extruding

A second common process uses processes of extrusion. In these cases, materials are processed into a liquid like goo \(think play-doh\) and pressed through narrow openings named after a spider's "spinneret." The single streams of material emerging from the spinneret are either  spun directly into fiber or deposited into liquid chemical baths as part of their structural formation. Often, extruding gives rise to filaments, where long continuous fibers are created. In other cases, the streams can be kept at deliberately short lengths to simulate more staple fiber like qualities \(think steel wool\).

## Plying

Plying consists of twisting multiple singles together. You can make cores and core-spun yarns using plying, but you cannot make hollow structures. You can ply with 2, 3, or however the hell many yarns you like, but its probably best to stay on the small side \(under 6\) to keep structure if you are doing this somewhat freehand. For bigger yarns or projects, you'll often see plies of plied yarn which are technically called "cabled" yarns. This is a yarn that is made by plying together previously plied yarns. 

If you want to ply yarns together, here is what you do. Each of the singles strands is twisted in one direction \(lets say Z twist\), independently of the other. Once they are all twisted to the desired angle the counter-acting twist is applied from the joined end in the opposite \(or in this case S-direction\) and propagates through the singles, joining them together.

## **Braiding**

Braiding is a technique that uses coils multiple strands, in different twist directions around a solid or hollow core. Industrial braiding uses a machine called a "[maypole machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKHuZEhrQ2E)" that is utterly fascinating to watch. Braiding is often used for creating sheaths around a core. What is nice about braiding is you can have a core that is a completely different material than the sheath without having to wrestle with too many different issues in tensioning. I have never worked with an industrial braiding machine, but making braided tubes by hand has opened up a lot of possibilities for experimenting with integrating many different materials. 

Braiding machines have yet to enter the DIY marketplace \([and this one is out of stock!](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mixedmediaeng/rope-omatic)\), but we can create small samples at least using a technique called **Kumihimo.** Kumihimo braiding is a technique in which several lengths of yarns are braided into hollow tubes. Kumihimo templates can be used to create braids with custom textures and patterning. The templates are easy to produce in cardboard on a laser cutter at various thicknesses. During this braiding, the maker has more control over tensions than they might with techniques that spin yarns together, thus, they may be ideal for applications that require brittle materials to be integrated into the outer structure of the yarn. It is also nice because it can adapt to several different numbers of individual yarns composing the braid. If you want to braid around a core, you simple pace your core material through the hole in the center and while you are braiding, it will wrap around that core on its own. A special thank you to [Pamela Liou](https://pamelaliou.com/) who was the first to introduce me to Kumihimo. There are many [patterns available online](https://prumihimo.com/resources/braiding-patterns/) that allow you to create braids with different cross sections ranging from square to semi-circular.

### **Selecting Yarn and Needle Size**



The relationship between the gauge of your yarn and the size of your knitting needle determines the drape or hand of your knitted textile. Most skeins of yarn will recommend a knitting needle size, but there are ways to play around with knits to create textiles that have multiple properties. For instance, you can use multiple needles when knitting, and change the tension of the knit as you are working. One could use a chunky yarn with a small needle to create a dense knitted textile. Or a lace weight yarn with large needles to create a very loose, soft textile. One fabric can change from densely knitted to and large open knit just by changing needle size. 

### 

**Machine Knitting:**  There are two main types of knitting machines that can used for tabletop knitting. The most common is a flat bed machine, which comes in two 'gauges', standard and chunky. The gauge of the machine refers to the spacing between the needles in the bed of the machine, which allows for different size yarns to run through the machine. These machines can be programmed electronically, or via punchcard. The second type of knitting machine is a 'V-bed' machine. V-bed knitting machines allow for more complex stitch structures and for double knits, and seamless knitting. 

I**ndustrial Knitting:** Industrial knitting machines produce the garments that we purchase in stores today. They are programmed via computer. These knitting machines can knit incredibly complex structures, and seamless garments. One machine can do many things and accommodate different yarns, rather than having different machines for different structures and yarns. There are also industrial circular knitting machines that can knit tubes of fabric, spacer textiles, and multilayer knit fabrics. 

One final structure that may be useful, and it at least easier to prototype is a knitted i-cord. This structure is hollow with a knitted sheath. Unlike the other two structures, this sheath is quite stretchy. The downside is that the yarn will be a bit fat \(by yarn standards\). The structure can be created by [hand techniques](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfkFRa9tjns) or with wonderful little contraptions like and [embellish-knit ](https://www.studioknitsf.com/embellish-knit-cords-power-tools/)hand cranked i-cord maker. Traditionally used to make little pulls, like the ones on a hoodie, they can also be useful in creating yarn-like structures. When working by hand, you have much more flexibility with the materials and sizing of the cord. With some finessing, you can feed the machine \(or a hand knitter\) both conductive and non-conductive materials at the same time to create a conductive cord structure. This structure has been really useful for acting as a pull or strain sensor, or, when tied around my ribcage, makes a pretty robust breath sensor. The measuring works through resistive sensing. The knitting structure basically maximizes the length of the conductive thread. So when the cord is strained, it strains all fibers of the conductive yarns, tightening their structure and lowering the overall resistance .

## Coating

A method for adding some material or texture onto a material structure. Often by immersing and dying in a bath or spraying.  Painting can be seen as a process of coating, whereby pigments are applied to the surface of the structure. Other processes of coating include mercerization, whereby chemical processes are applied to change the chemical properties of the material in the structure.
