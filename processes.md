# Processes

## Combing & Carding

Carding yarns  "encourages the fibers to lie in multiple directions" \[yarn-i-tec-ture\] and is referred to as a "woolen" preparation of fibers. Carding fibers produces roving. Fibers of all different lengths are kept in this process. The goal of carding is to build up enough of a "mesh" of fibers that they hold together. These meshes, and the process, yields more airy, fluffy and soft yarns. Bundles of woolen fibers are most often called "roving" but you different preparations go by names batts, rolags, fauxlags, puin, cloud, and wool locks, each of which offers, as you expect, its own set of unique qualities to the fibers.

Combing fibers allows them to all align in the same direction.  This is used on fibers that then to be a uniform length. This preparation of fiber is called "worsted".  It is often used for making yarns that are more uniform, lustrous in color, durable, and a little wirey. Packages of worsted fiber are called "top"

## Spinning 

Spinning is a process of adding twist to fibers \(in the form of top or roving\) such that they form into a more structured and "balanced" yarn, which means that it won't un-spin easily. Spinning top or roving  produces [singles](structures.md#singles), a single strand of twisted yarn. Singles are unbalanced \(their twist is only in one direction\) and their are not very durable. It is also possible to spin raw fibers around other structures, such as wires or filaments in a process of [core spinning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nAfv3O_Qrk). 

To spin, a spinner drafts, or feeds, a collection of fibers into their spinning devices \(wheel or spindle\). The spinner users their hands \(or otherwise\) to control the propagation of the spin up the length of the unspun fiber. As the spin propagates along the length of the fiber, it is wound onto a spool. The final step in spinning is called finishing, by which the yarn can be washed, steamed, lassoed, whacked, menaced, and a whole host of other hilarious words, to help the yarn achieve is final state. This is essentially a process of making the yarn resemble the state you want it to stay in and you really don't know much until you've washed and laundered a textile project \(which is always frightening to me\).

### Spinning Wheel

The most common method of spinning requires a spinning wheel \(yes, the machine of fairy tale lore\), which requires a substantial amount of technique and know how to use it effectively. A spinning wheel requires the spinner to use their feet to spin the wheel at an even pace and both their hands to draw the fibers into the wheel. It is faster and produces higher quality yarn than the other techniques.

### Drop Spindle

A more accessible method of spinning can be accomplished using a drop spindle. A drop spindle is a modified top that one manually spins in order to add twist to the fiber.  This is an ancient practice that still largely resembles its process from 20,000 years ago. For those interested in how these techniques varied in medieval times by region, you may [enjoy this demonstration of technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&v=RERnzaTREyM&feature=emb_title).

| Structure | Ability to be Spun |
| :--- | :--- |
| Raw Fiber | yes, but not in a meaningful length |
| Filament | yes, if integrated as a core |
| Roving & Top | yes |
| Singles | yes, perhaps to add extra spin or customization |
| Plied Yarn | not sure \(add extra twist?\) |
| Braided Rope | not sure \(add extra twist?\) |
| Knits | no |
| Woven | no |
| Non-Wovens | no |
| Solid Objects | no |

## Extruding

A second common process uses processes of extrusion. In these cases, materials are processed into a liquid like goo \(think play-doh\) and pressed through narrow openings named after a spider's "spinneret." The single streams of material emerging from the spinneret are either spun directly into fiber or deposited into liquid chemical baths as part of their structural formation. Often, extruding gives rise to filaments, where long continuous fibers are created. In other cases, the streams can be kept at deliberately short lengths to simulate more staple fiber like qualities \(think steel wool\).  

| Structure | Ability to be Extruded |
| :--- | :--- |
| Raw Fiber | no |
| Filament | no \(unless reprocessed into an extrudable material\) |
| Roving & Top | no |
| Singles | no |
| Plied Yarn | no |
| Braided Rope | no |
| Knits | no |
| Woven | no |
| Non-Wovens | no |
| Solid Objects | sure, clay, playdough, pasta, etc.  |

## Plying

Plying consists of twisting multiple singles together. You can make cores and core-spun yarns using plying, but you cannot make hollow structures. You can ply with 2, 3, or however the hell many yarns you like, but its probably best to stay on the small side \(under 6\) to keep structure if you are doing this somewhat freehand. 

Plying is most often used to make a yarn "balanced." Meaning that the yarn contains twists in two directions that hold it a steady structure.  Thus, plying yarns must occur in the opposite direction that they were spun. The twist of yarns is described as "Z-twist" or "S-twist" and it is a measure relative to your own body. 

![describing twist direction: PKM / Public domain](.gitbook/assets/yarn_twist-1.png)

If you want to ply yarns together, here is what you do. Each of the singles strands is already contains a twist \(lets say Z-twist\) in one direction. Align all your singles so they are oriented in the same direction \(all Z-twist\) and then join them together by twisting them together in the opposite direction \(the S-direction\). If plying already plied yarns, add twist in one direction  to each strand independently and then, starting from their shared end, twist them in the opposite direction to allow them to form onto each-other. 

Below are several mechanisms you can use to ply yarns: 

### Spinning Wheel

A spinning wheel is the most common method of plying long lengths of yarn  by craft spinners, as shown in this tutorial: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?time\_continue=1&v=ibpaZXq1eiU&feature=emb\_title](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=ibpaZXq1eiU&feature=emb_title)

### **Drop Spindle**

A drop spindle can also works for plying as shown in this demonstration of creating a 2x2 ply yarn. 

![](.gitbook/assets/compound-image%20%281%29.png)

It can also be used to join two different materials, as in this example of plying custom heating Wire**,** [Anne-Marie Lavigne](http://emeteuz.com/woven-signals). In this case, they are able to produce very long lengths of custom yarn.

You can also ply by hand by twisting any long and durable material in your hands, in one direction, folding it, and gently encourage its natural inclination to spin in the other direction.

| Structure | Ability to be Plied |
| :--- | :--- |
| Raw Fiber | no, needs to be in the form of singles first |
| Filament | yes |
| Roving & Top | yes?, for a more open and loose structure  |
| Singles | yes |
| Plied Yarn | yes |
| Braided Rope | yes \(I don't see why not?\) |
| Knits | yes for tubular knits or narrow flat knits |
| Woven | yes for narrow, flat, or tubular weaves |
| Non-Wovens | yes, if sliced or rolled into thin long pieces |
| Solid Objects | yes, often if integrated as a core and plied around |

## **Braiding**

Braiding is a technique that uses coils multiple strands, in different twist directions around a solid or hollow core. Industrial braiding uses a machine called a "[maypole machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKHuZEhrQ2E)" that is utterly fascinating to watch. Braiding is often used for creating sheaths around a core. What is nice about braiding is you can have a core that is a completely different material than the sheath without having to wrestle with too many different issues in tensioning. I have never worked with an industrial braiding machine, but making braided tubes by hand has opened up a lot of possibilities for experimenting with integrating many different materials. 

### Kumihimo Disk

Braiding machines have yet to enter the DIY marketplace \([and this one is out of stock!](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mixedmediaeng/rope-omatic)\), but we can create small samples at least using a technique called **Kumihimo.** Kumihimo braiding is a technique in which several lengths of yarns are braided into hollow tubes. Kumihimo templates can be used to create braids with custom textures and patterning. The templates are easy to produce in cardboard on a laser cutter at various thicknesses. During this braiding, the maker has more control over tensions than they might with techniques that spin yarns together, thus, they may be ideal for applications that require brittle materials to be integrated into the outer structure of the yarn. It is also nice because it can adapt to several different numbers of individual yarns composing the braid. If you want to braid around a core, you simple pace your core material through the hole in the center and while you are braiding, it will wrap around that core on its own. A special thank you to [Pamela Liou](https://pamelaliou.com/) who was the first to introduce me to Kumihimo. There are many [patterns available online](https://prumihimo.com/resources/braiding-patterns/) that allow you to create braids with different cross sections ranging from square to semi-circular.

**Hand Knitting** 

### **Selecting Yarn and Needle Size**



The relationship between the gauge of your yarn and the size of your knitting needle determines the drape or hand of your knitted textile. Most skeins of yarn will recommend a knitting needle size, but there are ways to play around with knits to create textiles that have multiple properties. For instance, you can use multiple needles when knitting, and change the tension of the knit as you are working. One could use a chunky yarn with a small needle to create a dense knitted textile. Or a lace weight yarn with large needles to create a very loose, soft textile. One fabric can change from densely knitted to and large open knit just by changing needle size. 

### 

**Machine Knitting:**  There are two main types of knitting machines that can used for tabletop knitting. The most common is a flat bed machine, which comes in two 'gauges', standard and chunky. The gauge of the machine refers to the spacing between the needles in the bed of the machine, which allows for different size yarns to run through the machine. These machines can be programmed electronically, or via punchcard. The second type of knitting machine is a 'V-bed' machine. V-bed knitting machines allow for more complex stitch structures and for double knits, and seamless knitting. 

I**ndustrial Knitting:** Industrial knitting machines produce the garments that we purchase in stores today. They are programmed via computer. These knitting machines can knit incredibly complex structures, and seamless garments. One machine can do many things and accommodate different yarns, rather than having different machines for different structures and yarns. There are also industrial circular knitting machines that can knit tubes of fabric, spacer textiles, and multilayer knit fabrics. 

One final structure that may be useful, and it at least easier to prototype is a knitted i-cord. This structure is hollow with a knitted sheath. Unlike the other two structures, this sheath is quite stretchy. The downside is that the yarn will be a bit fat \(by yarn standards\). The structure can be created by [hand techniques](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfkFRa9tjns) or with wonderful little contraptions like and [embellish-knit ](https://www.studioknitsf.com/embellish-knit-cords-power-tools/)hand cranked i-cord maker. Traditionally used to make little pulls, like the ones on a hoodie, they can also be useful in creating yarn-like structures. When working by hand, you have much more flexibility with the materials and sizing of the cord. With some finessing, you can feed the machine \(or a hand knitter\) both conductive and non-conductive materials at the same time to create a conductive cord structure. This structure has been really useful for acting as a pull or strain sensor, or, when tied around my ribcage, makes a pretty robust breath sensor. The measuring works through resistive sensing. The knitting structure basically maximizes the length of the conductive thread. So when the cord is strained, it strains all fibers of the conductive yarns, tightening their structure and lowering the overall resistance .

| Woven | yes for narrow, flat, or tubular weaves |
| Non-Wovens | yes, if sliced or rolled into thin long pieces |
| Solid Objects | yes, if its something you can thread through  |

## Weaving

The basic structure of weaving, no matter the type of loom, is the interlacing of yarns. You begin by preparing your warp yarns, or the series of tensioned that you will interlace. These are most often stretched parallel to each other but can also be arranged in other radial or triaxial patterns. After these are stretched and of uniform tension, you weave a long thread in and out, or over and under, the warp yarns. The combination of overs and unders and the sequencing will determine the visual and structural nature of your fabric. After adding a row over and under the weft, you can beat or comb it down to form the fabric. 

As you might expect, hand threading a yarn over and under every row can be tedious, which has given rise to the development of heddles, or, contraptions that lift the yarns for you. When the heddle lefts the yarn all you do is throw you yarn through the opening, or shed, lower the heddle and beat the row you just laid to meet the fabric.

## Coating

A method for adding some material or texture onto a material structure. Often by immersing and dying in a bath or spraying.  Painting can be seen as a process of coating, whereby pigments are applied to the surface of the structure. Other processes of coating include mercerization, whereby chemical processes are applied to change the chemical properties of the material in the structure.
