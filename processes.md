## Combing & Carding

Carding yarns  "encourages the fibers to lie in multiple directions" \[yarn-i-tec-ture\] and is referred to as a "woolen" preparation of fibers. Carding fibers produces roving. Fibers of all different lengths are kept in this process. The goal of carding is to build up enough of a "mesh" of fibers that they hold together. These meshes, and the process, yields more airy, fluffy and soft yarns. Bundles of woolen fibers are most often called "roving" but you different preparations go by names batts, rolags, fauxlags, puin, cloud, and wool locks, each of which offers, as you expect, its own set of unique qualities to the fibers.

Combing fibers allows them to all align in the same direction.  This is used on fibers that then to be a uniform length. This preparation of fiber is called "worsted".  It is often used for making yarns that are more uniform, lustrous in color, durable, and a little wirey. Packages of worsted fiber are called "top"

| Structure | Ability to be Combed and Carded |
| :--- | :--- |
| Fiber | yes |
| Filament | no |
| Roving & Top | perhaps? but unlikely |
| Singles | no |
| Plied Yarn | no |
| Braided Rope | no |
| Knits | no |
| Woven | no |
| Non-Wovens | no |
| Solid Objects | sure, but why? |

## Spinning 

Spinning is a process of adding twist to fibers such that they form into a more structured and durable yarn. Spinning raw fibers produces singles while it is also possible to spin raw fibers around other structures, such as wires or filaments. 

To spin, a spinner drafts, or feeds, a collection of fibers into their spinning devices \(wheel or spindle\). As the spin propagates along the length of the fiber, it is wound onto a spool. The final step in spinning is called  finishing, by which the yarn can be washed, steamed, lassoed, whacked, menaced, and a whole host of other hilarious words, to help the yarn achieve is final state. This is essentially a process of making the yarn resemble the state you want it to stay in and you really don't know much until you've washed and laundered a textile project \(which is always frightening to me\).

## Extruding

A second common process uses processes of extrusion. In these cases, materials are processed into a liquid like goo \(think play-doh\) and pressed through narrow openings named after a spider's "spinneret." The single streams of material emerging from the spinneret are either  spun directly into fiber or deposited into liquid chemical baths as part of their structural formation. Often, extruding gives rise to filaments, where long continuous fibers are created. In other cases, the streams can be kept at deliberately short lengths to simulate more staple fiber like qualities \(think steel wool\).
