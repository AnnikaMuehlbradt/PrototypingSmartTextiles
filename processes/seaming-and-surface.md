# Seaming

## Sewing

## Linking

In knitwear design, there are three main ways to construct a garment. **Fully fashioned** knitwear is when each piece of the garment is knit separately and joined together. Cut and sew knitwear is when yardage is created and pattern pieces are used to cut out the shapes of the garment and they are sewn together. Seamless knitwear is when the entirety of the garment is constructed at once, there are no separate pieces to be joined in any manner.
