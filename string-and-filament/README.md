## Preparing Fibers for Spinning

### Obtaining/Synthesizing Raw Fibers 

### Carding and Combing

The hand-spinning process starts by obtaining fibers which are sold in **worsted** or **woolen** form. Worsted means that the fibers are combed so that they all align in the same direction and are of uniform length. This is often used for making yarns that are more  uniform, lustrous in color, durable, and a little wirey. Packages of worsted fiber are called "top" and you can buy them for your own hand-spinning projects.

Woolen means that the fibers are "carded" which "encourages the fibers to lie in multiple directions" \[yarn-i-tec-ture\]. Fibers of all different lengths are kept in this process. The goal of carding is to build up enough of a "mesh" of fibers that they hold together. These meshes, and the process, yields more airy, fluffy and soft yarns. Bundles of worsted fibers are most often called "roving" but you different preparations go by names batts, rolags, fauxlags, puin, cloud, and wool locks, each of which offers, as you expect, its own set of unique qualities to the fibers.

## How to Spin 

Present day spinning happens by a community of hand-spinners as well as industrial textile mills, each of which automate the spinning process for a specific fiber and structure and typically do everything from processing the raw fiber, spinning the yarn, and weaving fabrics. Each process of spinning, specifically, adds specific characteristics to the yarn, for instance, making it thicker, more wirey, or more fluffy determined, in large part, by the amount of twist given to the fibers. When hand spinning, you have much more room for experimentation with these techniques, and the ways in which they production yarn with radically different properties and textures. Because we're thinking of ways to adapt these processes to our own experiments, and we don't have textile factories readily available, I'll focus on the hand techniques.

Most hand-spinners spin on [present-day spinning wheels](https://schachtspindle.com/product-category/ladybug-spinning-wheel/). These require coordination between hands and feet as the spinner uses foot pedals to keep the wheel spinning at a constant and desired rate for feeding the fibers and twisting them as needed, and carefully draws fibers into the wheel to achieve their desired yarn. The spinning of the wheel is the mechanism that adds the twist that allows the fiber to become yarn, or in this case, singles.  The yarn typically goes through processes of plying or finishing, which enhance or draw out other characteristics.This process requires a great deal of practice and feel, but \(I imagine\) it can be especially rewarding when you are able to craft yarns that you would be unable to buy otherwise. 

### Brief history of Spinning

With evidence to suggest that spinning yarn was taking place over 20,000 years ago, spinning continues to be one of the primary methods of producing yarn, though the social and cultural politics of that production has changed over time.The earliest spinners attached raw fibers \(of wool, flax, etc\), to a spindle. The spindle was tossed in such a way that is spun through the air as the spinner fed it with fibers. For those interested in how these techniques varied in medieval times by region, you may [enjoy this demonstration of technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&v=RERnzaTREyM&feature=emb_title).

As cloth became a major commodity in [China, India, and Islamic regions, the demand for yarn rose and people started to search for faster ways to spin yarn](https://quatr.us/china/invented-spinning-wheel-history-spinning.htm). The **spinning wheel**, of fairy tales and fables, was developed [between 500 and 1000 AD though the region of the invention is contested](https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_1200991#:~:text=The%20process%20predates%20written%20history,those%20making%20fiber%20into%20yarn.) \(some say India, others China or Iran\). [Some argued the origins of the spinning wheel trace to China as well](https://www.thoughtco.com/spinning-wheel-evolution-1992414). You might say that the spinning wheel was the first step towards industrialization in textiles and by the 14th century, the Chinese had come up with water-powered spinning wheels. The power of the wheel is this is could turn faster and for longer than a hand spinner.

### Drafting

To make matters more confusing, the terms worsted and woolen also describe techniques you can use to feed or "draft" the fibers from your top or roving into the wheel.  These, again, allow for more or less air to become trapped into the yarn, changing its thickness, durability, and likely its capacity for insulation \(I'm guessing, since air is a good insulator\). I won't get into the specifics of how to draft with each of these techniques, but I'm finding the book "Yarn-i-tec-ture" to be a great resource for those interested in going farther. The main point here is to say that the process of spinning is far from uniform. Even if you are spinning with the exact same fiber, the preparation and spin will result in very different properties.

### Spinning

....

### Finishing

The final step in yarn production is finishing, by which the yarn can be washed, steamed, lassoed, whacked, menaced, and a whole host of other hilarious words, to help the yarn achieve is final state. This is essentially a process of making the yarn resemble the state you want it to stay in and you really don't know much until you've washed and laundered a textile project \(which is always frightening to me\).

## Describing Yarns

So now that we understand that yarns are made of twisted fibers, which have then become into much larger and stronger plied or cabled fiber, we may come to understand the numbers that people use to describe yarns. Its also important to note that there are many different measures depending on what you want to describe and not all yarns are spun equal. You can add lots of spin, a little spin, lots of ply, a few plys and so on and so on and each will change the behavior. Futhermore, the ways that yarn is described for knitting is not always the same way yarn is described for weaving \(they are, after-all, very different processes\).Then we add conductive things to this mix and all the sudden we have to deal with conventions in the way wires are measured. 

The most commonly used 



Thankfully, there are terms that help us understand the properties that make the most impact and characterize different yarns.

[Wraps per inch](https://www.craftyarncouncil.com/standards/how-measure-wraps-inch-wpi): This measure the width of the yarn. It is measured by counting how many wraps you can make around a length of 1 inch. Careful, pulling or not pulling the yarn will change this, best to shoot for a tension somewhere in the middle.

[Gauge](https://www.craftyarncouncil.com/standards/yarn-weight-system): This measures how many stitches \(knitting\) you can fit within a four inch row of stockinette knit. The category of gauge is one of the most common when purchasing yarn, and also determines the size or your tools. I found this horribly confusing when I was learning, so its useful to have a guide.  Woven fabrics typically use different measures such as warps-per-inch which vary on the stitch...but more on that later.

Twist Angle: A measure how how tightly the yarn is twisted. This matters because you may find that the amount of twist greatly changes the behavior of your fabric, especially when you are looking for textured or three-dimensional effects in the textile. [There are really fancy ways to measure twist precisely](https://textilestudycenter.com/twist-measurement-in-yarn/), but for the most part you can use a protractor and some careful looking to determine the twist angle. The higher the angle the tighter the twist.
