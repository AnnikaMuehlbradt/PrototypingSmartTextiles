A filament is a fiber of unlimited or very long length. Filaments are typically produced through [extrusion](), are of uniform length and quality. \_\*\*\_Silk is said to be a natural filament because it can be harvested in single lengths that are very long. Other common filaments include copper magnet wire, nylon, and rayon.

### **Primary Measurements**

* **type:** the source of the filament
* **fiber diameter:** the cross-sectional diameter of the fiber, measured in Âµm or [AWG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_wire_gauge)

  filaments are available as monofilaments or multifilaments. Monofilaments refer to a single continuous length of filament where multifilaments consist of several filaments [twisted]() or [braided]() together.
