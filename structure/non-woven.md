# Non-Woven

Non-wovens describe a class of textile structures that does involve the use of fiber or its processing into yarn. Instead, non-wovens are textile-like materials that are created by other processes of extruding \(e.g. chainmail or 3D printed textiles\), growing \(such as leather or kombucha\), felting, a process by which individual fibers are tangled so much as to form a durable surface or structure, or electrospinning, where fibers are bonded into a fabric through electrical charge. These structures range in properties. Grown, felted, and electrospun materials are often not structurally stretchy, as they are relatively uniform and solid structures.

### Primary Measurements:

The method of describing or measuring a non-woven would vary by the material.
