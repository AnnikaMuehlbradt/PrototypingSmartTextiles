singles describes the first structure that emerges after roving or top are given spin. Most yarns are often made from several strands of singles. 

Singles are produced when roving or top are twisted in the process of [spinning](../process/spinning/), turning into a longer yarn-like structure. All yarns are created through one or more singles together, in a process called [plying](../process/plying/) which adds additional structure and texture to yarn.

### **Primary Measurements**

* **twists per inch:** the amount of twist applied to create the singles \(can also be expressed as a twist angle\). 
* **wraps per inch:** a measure of the width of the single calculated by winding around a one inch length at a neutral tension. 
* **denier:** describes the mass of a singles for a given length. Specifically, the number of grams per 9000 meters. a single strand of silk has a denier of 1, meaning that higher deniers carry more mass than silk and lower deniers are finer than silk. Anything with a denier less than than one is typically referred to as being made of "microfiber"
