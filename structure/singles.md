Singles are produced when roving or top are twisted in the process of [spinning](), turning into a longer yarn-like structure. All yarns are created through one or more singles together, in a process called [plying]() which adds additional structure and texture to yarn.

### **Primary Measurements**

* **twists per inch:** the amount of twist applied to create the singles \(can also be expressed as a twist angle\). 
* **wraps per inch:** a measure of the width of the single calculated by winding around a one inch length at a neutral tension. 
* **denier:** describes the mass of a singles for a given length. Specifically, the number of grams per 9000 meters. a single strand of silk has a denier of 1, meaning that higher deniers carry more mass than silk and lower deniers are finer than silk. Anything with a denier less than than one is typically referred to as being made of "microfiber"
