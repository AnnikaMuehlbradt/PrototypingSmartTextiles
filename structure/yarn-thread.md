# Yarn / Thread

The terms yarn and thread typically describe any material that is long and thin. However, they are not indicative of a particular structure. 

A thread describes a very thin yarn, so "yarn" is the broader term. Both threads and yarns can take the form of [filament](filament.md), [singles](singles.md), [plied yarn](plied-yarn.md), [core-spun yarn](core-spun-yarn.md), or [braids](braid.md). 

At times you might see yarns described as "knitting" or "weaving" yarns, but this only indicates the kind of application the designer envisioned for the yarn and likely a set of properties it might have \(e.g. knitting yarns tend to be softer and weaving yarns are stronger\). All yarns can be knitted and/or woven.
