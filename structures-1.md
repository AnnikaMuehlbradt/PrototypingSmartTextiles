# Structures

## Staple **Fiber**

this is the name given to one of the primary structures of textile, a material with a high length to width ratio.  

### **Primary Measurements**

* **type**
* **staple length**
* **fiber diameter**
* **crimp**

## **Filament**

The name given to fibers of unlimited length. Filaments are typically produced through [extrusion](processes.md#extruding), are of uniform length and quality.  

### **Primary Measurements**

* **type**
* **fiber diameter**

## **Roving & Top**

The most primary fiber structure is roving or top, produced by combing or carding individual fibers into into a common direction prior to spinning. Typically, this structure is produced prior to [spinning]() it into a "single" strand of yarn. Typically, fibers prepared by carding are called "worsted" and sold as top. Fibers prepared by combing are called "woolen" and sold as roving.   
  
Conductive Materials, like stainless steel, can be purchased as roving and hand spun:

### **Primary Measurements**

## **Singles**

Singles are produced when roving or top is spun into a longer yarn-like structure. Singles are typically plied to add additional structure and texture to yarn.

### **Primary Measurements**

* **twists per inch**
* **wraps per inch**
* **denier**

## **Plied Yarn**

The yarn or thread that you purchase for projects just as knitting, sewing or weaving is plied. Plying is a process of twisting yarns together to add additional structure**.** Plying is a process that can be repeated on other plied yarns. Creating plies of plied yarn created cords. 

### **Primary Measurements**

Note, yarns tend to be described differently by their suppliers and the application that they intend for the yarn to be used within. However, any yarn can be used for any application.

* **gauge \(knitting\)**: [https://www.craftyarncouncil.com/standards/yarn-weight-system](https://www.craftyarncouncil.com/standards/yarn-weight-system)
* **ratios \(weaving\)**: weaving yarns are sold with measurements describing the weight of the yarn and number of plys: ****[**https://spinoffmagazine.com/yarn-numbers-mean-weaving-yarns/**](https://spinoffmagazine.com/yarn-numbers-mean-weaving-yarns/)\*\*\*\*

* [Ratios \(Conductive Yarns/Filaments\)](https://www.kobakant.at/DIY/?p=379): Some sellers of conductive yarns also follow this convention, only their numbers are a bit more wild like 117/17 Silver 2-ply or something wild. [Kobakant](https://www.kobakant.at/DIY/?p=379) helped me understand this by noting that the numerator indicates the Denier, the denominator is the number of _filaments_, and the 2-ply describes the number of plies. Denier is the mass in grams of 9000 meters. [The measure is based on a single thread of silk, which has a denier of 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_textile_measurement). Some indicate that they use d-tex instead of denier which is the mass per kilogram \)10000 meters. I can't say I totally understand this but for the product above, I would guess it means that 17 filaments make up each "ply" within the two ply structure and each of those groups of 17 filaments has a Denier of 117. I still find this so confusing. 

  Conductive threads, especially when they are filament based, are often materials such as nylon that have been plated with a thin coating of metal. They are not typically solid metal \(though you can find solid metal in threads through some supplies\). 

  [AWG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_wire_gauge): To add another hitch to our measuring questions, sometimes resellers will describe their yarns/wires in terms of AWG, which is a measure that corresponds to the diameter of a cross-section of the wire but is wacky in that it scales logarithmically. The rule of thumb for me, using copper, is that the higher the number the thinner the wire. 40 AWG copper is about as thin as my hair and breaks easily. Something between 36-28 AWG has been the ideal for textile work as it is relatively strong yet also very thin and workable into the textile structure.
