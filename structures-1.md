# Structures

## Staple **Fiber**

this is the name given to one of the primary structures of textile, a material with a high length to width ratio and

## **Filament**

The name given to fibers of unlimited length. Filaments are typically produced through extrusion, are of uniform length and quality.

## **Roving & Top**

The most primary fiber structure is roving or top, produced by combing or carding individual fibers into into a common direction prior to spinning. Typically, this structure is produced prior to [spinning](structures/string-and-filament.md#spinning) it into a "single" strand of yarn. Typically, fibers prepared by carding are called "worsted" and sold as top. Fibers prepared by combing are called "woolen" and sold as roving.   
  
Conductive Materials, like stainless steel, can be purchased as roving and hand spun:
