# Structures

## Staple **Fiber**

Staple fiber is the name given to one of the primary structures of textile, a material with a high length to width ratio.  Some staple fibers are  harvested from animals \(sheep, goats, alpaca\), insects \(spiders, caterpillars\), and plants \(linen, cotton, etc\). Others are produced synthetically trough [extrusion](processes.md#extruding) of solutions containing metals or polymers. 

#### **Primary Measurements**

* **type:** the source of the fiber
* **staple length:** the length of the fiber, measured in mm
* **fiber diameter:** the cross-sectional diameter of the fiber, measured in µm
* **crimp:** the overall shape of the fiber, some have kinks and crimps

## **Filament**

A filament is a fiber of unlimited or very long length. Filaments are typically produced through [extrusion](processes.md#extruding), are of uniform length and quality. Common filaments include copper magnet wire, nylon, and rayon. 

#### **Primary Measurements**

* **type:** the source of the filament
* **fiber diameter:** the cross-sectional diameter of the fiber, measured in µm or [AWG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_wire_gauge)

{% hint style="info" %}
  filaments are available as monofilaments or multifilaments. Monofilaments refer to a single continuous length of filament where multifilaments consist of several filaments [twisted](processes.md#plying) or [braided](processes.md#braiding) together. 
{% endhint %}

## **Roving and Top**

The most primary fiber structure is roving or top, produced by combing or carding individual fibers into into a common direction prior to spinning. Typically, this structure is produced prior to [spinning](processes.md#spinning) it into a "single" strand of yarn. Typically, fibers prepared by [carding](processes.md#combing-and-carding) are called "worsted" and sold as top. Fibers prepared by [combing](processes.md#combing-and-carding) are called "woolen" and sold as roving. 

#### **Primary Measurements**

**type:**  the plant or breed of the combed/carded fiber  
**staple length**: the average staple length of the fibers within the roving.

_because roving and top can easily be pulled to cut or twisted back into their structure, the length of the roving/top itself is less important. It assumes people will pull off the amount of roving/top they need at any given time._ 

## **Singles**

Singles are produced when roving or top are twisted, turning into a longer yarn-like structure. Singles are typically [plied](processes.md#plying) to add additional structure and texture to yarn.

#### **Primary Measurements**

* **twists per inch**
* **wraps per inch**
* **denier**

## **Plied Yarn**

The yarn or thread that you purchase for projects just as knitting, sewing or weaving is plied. Plying is a process of twisting yarns together to add additional structure**.** They are characterized by a single direction of twist, called Z or S twist relative to the viewer**.**  Plying is a process that can be repeated on other plied yarns. Creating plies of plied yarn creates "cabled" yarns.

#### **Primary Measurements**

Note, yarns tend to be described differently by their suppliers and the application that they intend for the yarn to be used within. However, any yarn can be used for any application.

* **wraps per inch:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4MuKCCNoCk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4MuKCCNoCk)
* **gauge \(knitting\)**: [https://www.craftyarncouncil.com/standards/yarn-weight-system](https://www.craftyarncouncil.com/standards/yarn-weight-system)
* **ratios \(weaving\)**: weaving yarns are sold with measurements describing the weight of the yarn and number of plys: ****[**https://spinoffmagazine.com/yarn-numbers-mean-weaving-yarns/**](https://spinoffmagazine.com/yarn-numbers-mean-weaving-yarns/)\*\*\*\*
* **conductrive** 
* [Ratios \(Conductive Yarns/Filaments\)](https://www.kobakant.at/DIY/?p=379): Some sellers of conductive yarns also follow this convention, only their numbers are a bit more wild like 117/17 Silver 2-ply or something wild. [Kobakant](https://www.kobakant.at/DIY/?p=379) helped me understand this by noting that the numerator indicates the Denier, the denominator is the number of _filaments_, and the 2-ply describes the number of plies. Denier is the mass in grams of 9000 meters. [The measure is based on a single thread of silk, which has a denier of 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_textile_measurement). Some indicate that they use d-tex instead of denier which is the mass per kilogram \)10000 meters. I can't say I totally understand this but for the product above, I would guess it means that 17 filaments make up each "ply" within the two ply structure and each of those groups of 17 filaments has a Denier of 117. I still find this so confusing. 

  Conductive threads, especially when they are filament based, are often materials such as nylon that have been plated with a thin coating of metal. They are not typically solid metal \(though you can find solid metal in threads through some supplies\). 

  [AWG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_wire_gauge): To add another hitch to our measuring questions, sometimes resellers will describe their yarns/wires in terms of AWG, which is a measure that corresponds to the diameter of a cross-section of the wire but is wacky in that it scales logarithmically. The rule of thumb for me, using copper, is that the higher the number the thinner the wire. 40 AWG copper is about as thin as my hair and breaks easily. Something between 36-28 AWG has been the ideal for textile work as it is relatively strong yet also very thin and workable into the textile structure.

## **Braid** 

A braid is a structure that is created by interlacing singles, plied yarns and/or filaments in a tubular structure. A braid is a hollow structure, and is often used in 'core-spinning" where by a core material is sheathed by the braided material.

## **Knits**

A knit is a textile structure created by arranging material \(most often [plied yarn](structures.md#plied-yarn) and[ filaments](structures.md#filament)\) into a series of interconnecting loops. These interconnecting loops can create a flat textile with the ability to stretch in all directions as well as tubular or circular structures that strength along their length and width .  Depending on the shape of the loops and the material used, the knit textile can have different amounts of stretch. Knitting allows for the construction of shapes without textile waste. One works with different patterns, structures, increasing and decreasing stitches to create shape. The structure of knits various by the stitches used in their production, which make the knit more or less stretching, more or less open in various regions of the overall structure. 

## Wovens

A woven textile structure is created by interlacing material \(most often [plied yarn](structures.md#plied-yarn) and[ filaments](structures.md#filament)\) in two directions: the warp \(threads running along the length, and weft, threads running along the width\). These structures are created by stretching a set of parallel yarns \(or radical yarns\), and then interweaving other yarns in a perpendicular direction to bind the textile together. The specific patterning of "overs" and "unders" gives the woven textile different thicknesses, sheer, and durability. Woven structures are not inherently as stretchy as knits. Some patterning allows for the creation of multi-layered textiles, where multiple layers and interlacements of layers can be woven at a time. 

## Non-Wovens

A non-woven textile is created by a process that does involve the use of fiber or its processing into yarn. Instead, non-wovens are textile like materials that are created by other processes of extruding \(e.g. chainmaill or 3D printed texitles, growing \(such as leather or kombucha\),  felting, a process by which individual fibers are tangled so much as to form a durable surface or structure, or electrospinning, where fibers are bonded into a fabric through electrical charge. These structures range in properties. Grown or felted and electrospun materials are often not structurally stretchy, as they are relatively uniform and solid structures.
