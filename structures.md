# Structures

## Staple **Fiber**

![cotton staple fibers \(via: https://www.needpix.com/\)](.gitbook/assets/cotton-1188323_1280.jpg)

Staple fiber is the name given to one of the primary structures of textile, a material with a high length to width ratio.  Some staple fibers are  harvested from animals \(sheep, goats, alpaca\), insects \(spiders, caterpillars\), and plants \(linen, cotton, etc\). Others fibers are produced synthetically through the [extrusion](processes.md#extruding) of solutions containing metals or polymers. 

#### **Primary Measurements**

* **type:** the source of the fiber
* **staple length:** the length of the fiber, measured in mm
* **fiber diameter:** the cross-sectional diameter of the fiber, measured in µm
* **crimp:** the overall shape of the fiber, some have kinks and crimps

## **Filament**

A filament is a fiber of unlimited or very long length. Filaments are typically produced through [extrusion](processes.md#extruding), are of uniform length and quality. ****Silk is said to be a natural filament because it can be harvested in single lengths that are very long. Other common filaments include copper magnet wire, nylon, and rayon. 

#### **Primary Measurements**

* **type:** the source of the filament
* **fiber diameter:** the cross-sectional diameter of the fiber, measured in µm or [AWG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_wire_gauge)

{% hint style="info" %}
 filaments are available as monofilaments or multifilaments. Monofilaments refer to a single continuous length of filament where multifilaments consist of several filaments [twisted](processes.md#plying) or [braided](processes.md#braiding) together.

## **Roving and Top**

Roving and or Top describe fibers that have been given and initial structure to hold them together, but have not yet been given any twist. These are produced by processes of [combing or carding](processes.md#combing-and-carding) individual fibers into into a common direction prior to [spinning](processes.md#spinning). Typically, [carding](processes.md#combing-and-carding) fibers entangling them in multiple directions \(think a dreadlock\). Collections of fibers prepared in this fashion referred to as "woolen"  and sold under the name **roving**. Thus, roving adds a springy and airy quality to a yarn when it is spun. Alternatively, some fibers are prepared through combing \(like a pony tail\) which aligns the individual fibers in a single direction and often removes fibers of unusual length. Fibers prepared by [combing](processes.md#combing-and-carding) are called "worsted" and sold as **top**. Worsted preparations tend to produce stronger and denser yarns when they are spun.

There are several products sold on the market such as "[carbon roving](https://www.compositeshop.de/xoshop/lng/en/fibers/carbon-fiber/carbon-roving-tenax-sts40-24k.html)" or "[glass roving](https://www.compositeshop.de/xoshop/lng/en/fibers/carbon-fiber/glass-roving-vetrotex-ec14-2400tex-p185.html)" that describe strands of continuous filaments laying mostly parallel to each other. These are structurally very different than roving made from staple fibers but share the quality of being the preparation before twist is added.  

#### **Primary Measurements**

**type:**  the plant or breed of the combed/carded fiber  
**staple length**: the average staple length of the fibers within the roving \(when applicable\)  
**yield**: the number of yards of roving per pound.

_because roving and top can easily be pulled to cut or twisted back into their structure, the length of the roving/top itself is less important. It assumes people will pull off the amount of roving/top they need at any given time._ 

## **Singles**

![](.gitbook/assets/3299380830_e09f66db1c_k%20%281%29.jpg)

  
Singles are produced when roving or top are twisted in the process of [spinning](processes.md#spinning), turning into a longer yarn-like structure. All yarns are created through one or more singles together, in a process called [plying](processes.md#plying) which adds additional structure and texture to yarn.

#### **Primary Measurements**

* **twists per inch:** the amount of twist applied to create the singles \(can also be expressed as a twist angle\). 
* **wraps per inch:** a measure of the width of the single calculated by winding around a one inch length at a neutral tension. 
* **denier:** describes the mass of a singles for a given length. Specifically, the number of grams per 9000 meters. a single strand of silk has a denier of 1, meaning that higher deniers carry more mass than silk and lower deniers are finer than silk. Anything with a denier less than than one is typically referred to as being made of "microfiber"

## **Plied Yarn**

![2-ply yarn. If you look closely, you can see the two individual singles strands twisted together. Image Credit: Natalia Wilson on Flickr.](.gitbook/assets/1516150719_9b653cf1e3_k.jpg)

The yarn or thread that you purchase for projects just as knitting, sewing or weaving is plied meaning that it has been created through a process of [plying](processes.md#plying) several [singles](structures.md#singles) yarns and/or [filaments](structures.md#filament) together. A 2-ply yarn is made of 2 singles, a 3-ply is made of three singles and so on. In some cases, yarns that have already been plied together can then be plied together another time  to create "cabled" yarn structures. So, to make a yarn with 4 plys, one has the option to either ply four singles together at once or make 2, 2-ply yarns and later ply them again into a single 4-ply yarn. The first is called 4-ply, the second 2x2ply. The cabled yarns will be more durable than the 4-ply yarns. 

You can find another description of plied structures [here](https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/what-is-plied-yarn-2116148#:~:text=Plies%20are%20the%20individual%20strands,doesn%27t%20make%20much%20sense.) and a description of [cabling](https://knitty.com/ISSUEdf10/KSFEATdf10glossary.php) [here](https://knitty.com/ISSUEdf10/KSFEATdf10glossary.php). 

#### **Primary Measurements**

Note, yarns tend to be described differently by their suppliers and the application that they intend for the yarn to be used within. However, any yarn can be used for any application.

* **wraps per inch:** A measure of yarn width calculated as the number of wraps of the yarn that can fit within an inch at a neutral tension. You can find a demonstration [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4MuKCCNoCk).
* **gauge \(knitting\)**: A measurement of yarn weight oriented towards knitting: [https://www.craftyarncouncil.com/standards/yarn-weight-system](https://www.craftyarncouncil.com/standards/yarn-weight-system)
* **ratios \(weaving\)**: weaving yarns are sold with measurements describing the weight of the yarn and number of plys within the structure. This includes measures like 20/2 Cotton or 10/2 tencel. The numerator describes the weight of the yarn, with _higher_ numbers indicating _finer_ weight. The denominator describes the number of plys:[ https://spinoffmagazine.com/yarn-numbers-mean-weaving-yarns/](https://spinoffmagazine.com/yarn-numbers-mean-weaving-yarns/)
* **ratios \(Conductive Yarns/Filaments\):** Some sellers of conductive yarns also follow this convention, only their numbers are a bit more wild like [117/17 Silver 2-ply](https://www.shieldextrading.net/products/yarns-threads/) or something wild. [Kobakant](https://www.kobakant.at/DIY/?p=379) helped me understand this by noting that the numerator indicates the Denier, the denominator is the number of _filaments_, and the 2-ply describes the number of plies. According to [Shieldex](https://www.shieldextrading.net/products/yarns-threads/), the denier applies to only one of the plies, meaning that the actual weight would need to be multiplied by 2.  I can't say I totally understand this but for the product above, I would guess it means that 17 filaments make up each "ply" within the two ply structure \(meaning the total number of filaments in the thread overall is 34. This is the weight prior to being coated with silver.  I still find this so confusing and it seems to shift by retailer. 
* **cross-sectional width \(Conductive Yarns/Filaments\):** To add another hitch to our measuring questions, sometimes resellers will describe their yarns/wires in terms of the diameter in microns or expressed as [AWG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_wire_gauge), which is a measure that corresponds to the diameter of a cross-section of the wire but is wacky in that it scales logarithmically. The rule of thumb for me, using copper, is that the higher the number the thinner the wire. 40 AWG copper is about as thin as my hair and breaks easily. Something between 36-28 AWG has been the ideal for textile work as it is relatively strong yet also very thin and workable into the textile structure.

## **Core Spun Yarns**

![A close up of the end of a core spun thread. The core consists of uninsulated copper, and the sheath was a synthetic fiber.](.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-07-27-at-1.42.12-pm.png)

![closeup of the synthetic sheath spun around the core.](.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-07-27-at-1.55.11-pm.png)

Core spun yarns describe a multi-layered yarn structure where fiber is spun around a single continuous filament in the core. This is a common technique for creating conductive yarns. The internal material is referred to as the core, and the outer is referred to as the sheath. There is a seemingly endless combination and set of techniques for constructing core spun yarns, which you can find [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/core-spun-yarn). 

## **Braid** 

A braid is a structure that is created by interlacing singles, plied yarns and/or filaments in a flat, but more often, tubular structure. A tubular braid is a hollow structure, and is often used in 'core-spinning" where by a core material is sheathed by the braided material. 

#### Primary Measurements: 

No Idea: 

## **Knits**

A knit is a textile structure created by arranging material \(most often [plied yarn](structures.md#plied-yarn) and[ filaments](structures.md#filament)\) into a series of interconnecting loops. These interconnecting loops can create a flat textile with the ability to stretch in all directions as well as tubular or circular structures that strength along their length and width .  Depending on the shape of the loops and the material used, the knit textile can have different amounts of stretch. Knitting allows for the construction of shapes without textile waste. One works with different patterns, structures, increasing and decreasing stitches to create shape. The structure of knits various by the stitches used in their production, which make the knit more or less stretching, more or less open in various regions of the overall structure. 

## Wovens

A woven textile structure is created by interlacing material \(most often [plied yarn](structures.md#plied-yarn) and[ filaments](structures.md#filament)\) in two directions: the warp \(threads running along the length, and weft, threads running along the width\). These structures are created by stretching a set of parallel yarns \(or radical yarns\), and then interweaving other yarns in a perpendicular direction to bind the textile together. The specific patterning of "overs" and "unders" gives the woven textile different thicknesses, sheer, and durability. Woven structures are not inherently as stretchy as knits. Some patterning allows for the creation of multi-layered textiles, where multiple layers and interlacements of layers can be woven at a time. 

## Non-Wovens

A non-woven textile is created by a process that does involve the use of fiber or its processing into yarn. Instead, non-wovens are textile like materials that are created by other processes of extruding \(e.g. chainmaill or 3D printed texitles, growing \(such as leather or kombucha\),  felting, a process by which individual fibers are tangled so much as to form a durable surface or structure, or electrospinning, where fibers are bonded into a fabric through electrical charge. These structures range in properties. Grown or felted and electrospun materials are often not structurally stretchy, as they are relatively uniform and solid structures.
