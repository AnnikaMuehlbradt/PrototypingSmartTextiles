# Harvesting or Synthesizing Fiber

Technically, a fiber is a material with "high length to width ratio" and they form the basic building blocks of yarn.

## Why Learn About Fiber Types?

So often in smart textiles development, we delegate "smartness" to the sensing or conductive wires/threads we integrate into our textiles. However, the traditional fibers of textiles, like wool or cotton, are also adaptive and responsive in many ways. They can be creatively combined and used with other materials to amplify or bring out specific qualities.  If we understand the properties and attributes that each fiber brings to the table, we might be able to make a wise decision about whether to use copper or silver wire in conjunction with wool or cotton base yarns depending on our application. For instance, if we want the use the wire to generate heat and want the body of the fabric to act as insulation, we would use wool. If we want the wire to simply transmit energy from here to there, and we are most concerned with the washability of our project, then we might choose silver and cotton. This chapter might be best used as a kind of reference material, but it offers an explanation of different fiber types to aid you in picking one for your project. 

## **Fiber Sources**

Fibers can be harvested from natural sources or synthesized within labs.  

### Harvesting

Harvested fibers come from materials such as plant matter, the fur of animals, or the cocoons of insects like worms. These resources are renewable, in a sense, if they are managed carefully. After being harvested, they are cleaned for processing into yarn. This often produces by-products in addition to the fiber itself. For instance, sheep are very very oily. When sheep's wool is collected, the oils that come off the wool are used to create "lanolin" a common ingredient in lotions. The cleaned fibers can then be used to create yarns. The silk harvested from cocoons is often the longest form of natural fiber, as each individual strand can be as long as 1000-3000 feet.  

### **Extruding**

A second common process uses processes of extrusion. In these cases, materials are processed into a liquid like goo \(think play-doh\) and pressed through narrow openings named after a spider's "spinneret." The single streams of material emerging from the spinneret are either  spun directly into fiber or deposited into liquid chemical baths as part of their structural formation. Often, extruding gives rise to filaments, where long continuous fibers are created. In other cases, the streams can be kept at deliberately short lengths to simulate more staple fiber like qualities \(think steel wool\).  

If you have an afternoon handy, there are many many youtube videos that describe how 

## Describing Fibers

There are many many features of fibers to describe, but what we'll focus on but two of the most common are:  **staple length** - this is a discrete measure of the average length of each fiber, typically measured in mm. The length of the fiber determines how thin/thick the resulting yarn needs to be and how it may feel against the skin \(in combination with many other factors\). Typically, very soft garments, come from short "downy" staple fibers collected from sheep or goats. Longer fibers tend to be stronger and used in more utilitarian applications like upholstery or rope making. **fiber diameter** - cross section of a fiber measured in nanometers. Another quality of interest is the **moisture regain** of the fiber, which is the amount of the fiber's weight which can be made up of water. This corresponds roughly to the absorbency of the fiber, and takes into account that many fibers can retain water without feeling wet. 

Fibers come from many kinds of substances but  generally broken down into two classes based on their _staple length_: **Staple fibers** are fibers of fixed length, often emerging from natural materials like fur and plants. **Filaments** are fibers of continuous quality and of very long, if not \(theoretically\) infinite, length. These are often made of synthetic materials and produced through processes of extrusion. But more on this later.

For the sake of our explanation of fibers and their properties, we will also describe particular qualities that contribute to a materials conductivity, resistance, and thermal conductance. **Conductivity** refers to how easily electricity can move through the fiber. If it conducts electricity relatively easily, it is colloquially called a conductive fiber. If electricity has a difficult time moving through the fiber, it is colloquially called an **insulator**. Similarly, at times you will hear the terms conductive or resistive used to describe conductive fibers. This generally applies only the the fibers that are easily conductive and basically differentiates how conductive they are. A conductive yarn means it is very conductive \(meaning it has low resistance\), or less conductive \(meaning it has more resistance\). 

Keep in mind, that these measures will change based on how tightly the fibers are wound \(which we can leverage for sensing\), the kinds of structures they are integrated into and external factors like how wet the fiber is and how much voltage is being applied to them.
