# Knit

A knit is a textile structure created by a series of interconnecting loops. These interconnecting loops create a textile with the ability to stretch in all directions. Knitting uses a continuous filament of material. Depending on the shape of the loops and the material used, the knit textile can have different amounts of stretch. Knitting allows for the construction of shapes without textile waste. One works with different patterns, structures, increasing and decreasing stitches to create shape. In this section, we will mainly focus on hand knitting, although some properties of machine knitting will be covered. In hand knitting, there are two main stitches, knit and purl, which make up two main types of knitted textile patterns, Garter and Stockinette.



## Why Learn about Knitting

## How Knit Fabrics are Produced

**Hand Knitting** 

**Machine Knitting:**  There are two main types of knitting machines that can used for tabletop knitting. The most common is a flat bed machine, which comes in two 'gauges', standard and chunky. The gauge of the machine refers to the spacing between the needles in the bed of the machine, which allows for different size yarns to run through the machine. These machines can be programmed electronically, or via punchcard. The second type of knitting machine is a 'V-bed' machine. V-bed knitting machines allow for more complex stitch structures and for double knits, and seamless knitting. 

I**ndustrial Knitting:** Industrial knitting machines produce the garments that we purchase in stores today. They are programmed via computer. These knitting machines can knit incredibly complex structures, and seamless garments. One machine can do many things and accommodate different yarns, rather than having different machines for different structures and yarns. There are also industrial circular knitting machines that can knit tubes of fabric, spacer textiles, and multilayer knit fabrics. 

How to Knot

## How to Hand Knit

### **Selecting Yarn and Needle Size**

The relationship between the gauge of your yarn and the size of your knitting needle determines the drape or hand of your knitted textile. Most skeins of yarn will recommend a knitting needle size, but there are ways to play around with knits to create textiles that have multiple properties. For instance, you can use multiple needles when knitting, and change the tension of the knit as you are working. One could use a chunky yarn with a small needle to create a dense knitted textile. Or a lace weight yarn with large needles to create a very loose, soft textile. One fabric can change from densely knitted to and large open knit just by changing needle size. 

### Primary Stitches

Purl

### Common Structures and their Properties

**Garter Stitch**: When all stitches are either knit or purl

**Stockinette**: When rows alternate between knit and purl

**Others?**

### **Useful techniques for integrating non-standard materials?**

**Which materials?** Pick the ones that bend well and like to bend a lot. 

### **Knitting in Three Dimensions**

There are many different types of stitches and structures in knitting. But I want to focus on the techniques used to create volume: increasing and decreasing stitches. Stitches can be added at any time during the knitting process, and in varying amounts in order to change the shape of the textile. Decreasing at similar or increased rates creates three dimensional volume.
