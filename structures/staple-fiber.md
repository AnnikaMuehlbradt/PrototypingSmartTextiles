![](../.gitbook/assets/cotton-1188323_1280.jpg)

Staple fiber is the name given to one of the primary structures of textile, a material with a high length to width ratio. Some staple fibers are harvested from animals \(sheep, goats, alpaca\), insects \(spiders, caterpillars\), and plants \(linen, cotton, etc\). Others fibers are produced synthetically through the [extrusion](../processes.md#extruding) of solutions containing metals or polymers.

### **Primary Measurements**

* **type:** the source of the fiber
* **staple length:** the length of the fiber, measured in mm
* **fiber diameter:** the cross-sectional diameter of the fiber, measured in Âµm
* **crimp:** the overall shape of the fiber, some have kinks and crimps
