# Application: Transatlantic Cable

I was lucky enough to be able to see one of the original pieces of the transatlantic cable at Henry Ford Museum. I couldn't help by love that this cable, this massive innovation moment, was just coils on coils on oils of wire and cable, spun just like yarn. Sometimes we need to look back in order to find ideas for the future and I like to see this as an example of the ways that "smart textile" structures and concepts have been embedded within our society long before the present moment.
